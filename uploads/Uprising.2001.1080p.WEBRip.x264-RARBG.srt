1
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,760
Such a boy!

2
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:38,126
Kazik. Kazik,
speak to me.

3
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:45,501
Let's get out of here!

4
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:50,136
Help...me.

5
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,387
No stinking Jews
in my line.

6
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:42,259
The bread is for those
on the Aryan side, not Jews.

7
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,030
Go to your side!
Go to the ghetto.

8
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:49,098
Officer, I'm a veteran of
the Polish armed services.

9
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,399
Then you are
a fighter, huh?

10
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:52,432
Uhh!

11
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:54,601
Uhh!

12
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,664
Mordechai Anielewicz,

13
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,926
you're wanted for work
detail. Let's go.

14
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,936
Work detail?
Where?

15
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,938
Who knows?
What's the difference?

16
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,110
Huh? All Jews
ordered to report.

17
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,339
Well, how will I know
what to wear?

18
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,535
Don't get smart.

19
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:38,306
Put on a shirt.
Let's get moving.

20
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:39,976
This work detail,

21
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,653
it wouldn't, by any chance,
be a German work detail.

22
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,093
I warned you.
I work for my people.

23
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,518
Now move!
Uhh!

24
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:51,055
You, a Jewish policeman,
are a traitor to your people.

25
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,361
For this alone,
I should kill you.

26
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,134
But, often I ask myself
the following:

27
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,173
Can a moral man--
that's me--

28
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:01,538
maintain his moral code
in an immoral world?

29
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,806
Does this question
interest you?

30
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,314
Get out of here,
before I hurt you.

31
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,551
Papa, why are so many
people moving here?

32
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:23,858
Just be glad you've
got the bread, Tosia.

33
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:37,843
Take off your hat.

34
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,341
No, thank you.

35
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:42,583
I said take off your hat.

36
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,846
Halt!

37
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,457
Hurry up!

38
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,285
What's the matter with you?

39
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:02,327
I take off my hat
for myself, Yitzhak,

40
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,862
for nobody else.

41
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:16,706
What now?

42
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:18,054
No!

43
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,908
No!

44
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:22,017
Oh, please stop.

45
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,049
Stop.
Let go.

46
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,153
No.

47
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,154
Please! Please stop.

48
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:29,456
It's my grandson, David.

49
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,790
The bastards.

50
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:33,664
Creates a Jewish police force
to do their dirty work,

51
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:36,264
unless, they feel like having
a little fun themselves.

52
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:38,266
Of course,
divide and conquer.

53
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,628
Yeah.
What is next?

54
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,735
Kazik.

55
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:49,044
What are you doing
with this fancy car?

56
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,036
Driving, if you
hadn't noticed.

57
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,348
Did you steal it?

58
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,719
Now, Mordechai...

59
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,378
Why would I steal
what I can have for free?

60
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,387
What scheme
are you up to now?

61
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,159
I am the official driver
for Adam Czerniakow.

62
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,960
The head of
the Jewish council?

63
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:08,632
That's who I'm here to pick
up, traffic permitting.

64
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,532
Help us set up a meeting
with your boss Czerniakow.

65
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:14,795
If I did that, as his driver,
I'd put my position at risk.

66
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,865
If you don't, you'd be
helping the Germans.

67
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,114
This doesn't worry you,
aiding the enemy?

68
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,209
I would worry more

69
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,080
if I couldn't feed myself
and what remains of my family.

70
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,750
Never mind how we deal
with the Jewish police, huh?

71
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,179
Never mind how we deal
with schooling the children.

72
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:30,175
We all have families--
Mordechai.

73
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,217
We don't want kazik
to lose his job.

74
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,461
Kazik.

75
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,590
I wish you well.

76
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,037
Mira's contacted some
sympathizers at the border,

77
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,540
who said they might get some
of our students out of Poland.

78
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:56,214
But it has to be
right away.

79
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:57,653
What do you think?

80
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:00,308
If you can get them out
of Poland and to Palestine,

81
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:03,577
then I would do it at once,
before the opportunity is lost.

82
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,787
Yeah.
I think you're right.

83
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:08,364
Wish me luck.

84
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,718
Luck.

85
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,255
Mordechai.

86
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,619
You are taking
these boys illegally.

87
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,285
All Jewish men
between the age of 12 to 60

88
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,094
are decreed to perform
forced labor.

89
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,596
Did you examine
their documents?
And you are?

90
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,129
Yitzhak Zuckerman,
their teacher.

91
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,873
Look at their documents.

92
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,229
These boys are legally
exempt from forced labor.

93
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,237
Yes, they are,
aren't they?
Ooh!

94
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,839
Today everyone works,
Zuckerman.

95
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,982
See that Zuckerman gets
the opportunity to work as well!

96
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,209
Uhh!

97
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,324
Hello, everyone.

98
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,192
Hello, everybody.

99
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,961
All take your seats, please.

100
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:16,989
Mordechai.

101
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:18,134
Yes, Julian.

102
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,658
I understand--

103
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,033
we understand
we might be leaving...

104
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,632
For Palestine,
through Romania, any day now.

105
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,295
What do you know about this?

106
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,873
Where did you hear this?
Rumor.

107
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,342
Rumor from where?
Rumor mill.

108
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,911
Rumor mill.

109
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,940
Uh, well, unfortunately, I have
to leave immediately today.

110
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:40,106
But I hope to return very soon
and address this naughty rumor.

111
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:42,547
In the meantime, taking my
place for today's lesson,

112
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,422
I have a very
special treat--

113
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,991
a renowned scholar
and rumormonger,

114
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,860
Mr. Julian Wald.

115
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,219
Julian, come
up here, please.

116
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,258
Ok, who remembers
today's topic?

117
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,434
Anybody?

118
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:59,332
Help me out here, because, uh,
I forgot to write it down.

119
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,496
Something
about morality?

120
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,974
Yes, Frania.

121
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:08,283
Can a moral man maintain his
moral code in an immoral world?

122
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:12,448
Very good. Ok, Julian?
You can work with that topic?

123
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,809
Uh, sure.

124
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,377
Good.

125
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:18,615
Ok. Today's topic--

126
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,222
can an immoral man

127
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:23,023
maintain his moral code...

128
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,486
On a first date?

129
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,700
So, everything is arranged
until you get to the border.

130
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:32,972
Mira...

131
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,040
But still...You'll have
to get across on your own.

132
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,509
Mm-hmm. And?

133
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:41,778
And if you find
a safe passage...

134
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:42,739
Yes?

135
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:45,876
If you find a safe passage
and return safely,

136
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:48,983
then you will
get a reward.

137
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,353
What kind of a reward?

138
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,055
Well, perhaps
the fulfillment

139
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,058
of your dreams.

140
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,330
Seeing your students
make the desert bloom

141
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,100
and become fertile.

142
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:05,901
That's it?

143
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:09,173
It's a lot of work. I mean,
you know. The danger alone is...

144
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:13,672
All right. Well, perhaps
the eternal gratitude

145
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:17,007
of your people
and of, uh,

146
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:20,884
a certain person
in particular.

147
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,654
Who?

148
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,022
Someone very close
to you.

149
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,823
What kind of gratitude?

150
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,268
What if I find
2 safe passages?

151
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,289
You can take off
your armband now.

152
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,428
Go.

153
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,832
Go.

154
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,545
Get down to the stream
and follow it.

155
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,117
Over there
is the border.

156
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,257
Is it very far?

157
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:42,361
No. You should reach a safe
house before nightfall.

158
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,755
They are aware
of your journey.

159
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,835
I will receive
my payment now.

160
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:53,712
Thank you very much.

161
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,480
Good luck to you.

162
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,818
Welcome to our country!

163
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,341
See if you can pull
around them.

164
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:44,121
Well, kazik, how did you get
this assignment driving my car?

165
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:47,551
Your other driver was taken
to a slave labor battalion.

166
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:48,587
And?

167
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:49,621
And, uh...

168
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:51,986
I was chosen to replace him.

169
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,830
Kazik...

170
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,001
Yes, sir.

171
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,129
Do not...
Steal the car.

172
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,497
Yes, sir.

173
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:15,018
Czerniakow, a detachment
of SS soldiers

174
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,178
under the command
of lieutenant Mueller

175
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,317
expended a number of hours

176
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:22,262
burning the Jewish
synagogue on Staffki street

177
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,819
upon request of
the health ministry

178
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,987
after finding
unsanitary conditions.

179
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:29,197
But the hostages
taken to Pawiak...

180
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,997
We provided you with
the paperwork yesterday.

181
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:35,843
For this operation, 30 liters
of benzene were expended,

182
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,338
for which we will expect
reimbursement.

183
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,511
For the Jewish council, there
will be 20 zlotys per liter--

184
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,981
600 zlotys.

185
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,780
We will get you
the funds.

186
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,782
About the other matter,

187
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,254
23 hostages were taken--

188
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,423
some--some women
and children--

189
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:56,222
all because a Polish police
officer was roughed up.

190
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,756
Certainly, the children--

191
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,790
this paperwork--
ah, yeah, here it is.

192
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,997
Commissar Auerswald...

193
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,530
You have appointed me to
administer to the needs

194
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,965
of 350,000 people.

195
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,371
I find it impossible
to manage the community

196
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:13,213
under these circumstances,
and I must ask you

197
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,210
to release me
from my position

198
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,412
as the head
of the Jewish council.

199
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,585
That would be inadvisable.

200
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:31,158
The fine levied on each
prisoner is 10,000 zlotys.

201
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:34,031
So if the Jewish council
wishes to pay the full fine--

202
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:37,161
230,000 zlotys--

203
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:41,067
make sure they do so
by 6 P.M. tomorrow.

204
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,771
So...heh heh.
You should get busy...

205
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,443
Czerniakow.

206
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,691
Stop!

207
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
What are you
hiding there?

208
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,164
Ah...

209
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,327
Smells good.

210
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,465
It'd be better with jam,
but...Try it.

211
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:19,635
Get out of here.

212
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,912
Oh, please, it's for my father.
He's very sick, needs it badly.

213
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,482
How badly?

214
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,048
Please.

215
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:33,749
Aah!

216
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,186
Tosia.

217
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,358
Now...get out of here.

218
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,532
Tosia, come.

219
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,730
Ahh!

220
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,074
Are you all right,
mama?

221
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,269
Oh, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

222
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,381
It's too dangerous
to go out like you do.

223
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:07,753
Hello, dear.

224
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,920
Come, Rachel.

225
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,588
Papa.

226
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:15,331
Go.

227
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:18,002
We're going to sell
a few books.

228
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm trying to keep
your favorites.

229
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,302
I think we need some more.

230
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,095
Do you want another blanket?
Are you warm enough?

231
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:27,238
I won't allow you.
Do you hear me?

232
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:31,844
Papa, I'm going to keep
your favorites.

233
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,848
And I'll bring back
bread.

234
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:38,022
Your mother thinks I
don't know she's sewing

235
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,250
for the rich Polish
women, but I do.

236
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:44,694
Make sure she's careful
on the streets.

237
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:45,794
So dangerous.

238
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:50,964
Promise me you won't
tell her I know.

239
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,097
I promise.

240
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,101
We have
to hurry, Rachel.

241
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,303
I promise, papa.

242
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:58,035
I got the hat.
Be careful on
the other side.

243
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,240
I will be, papa.
I will.

244
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,210
Now light
the shabbos candles.

245
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,124
Boruch ata adonai

246
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,164
eloheinu melech haolam...

247
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,969
Sorry I'm late.
You heard about
the ransom demand?

248
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,435
Yes. It's a terrible
situation.

249
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:39,545
I think now we must
ask your men to speak

250
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,749
with the relatives
of the hostages,

251
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,351
see what
they can contribute.

252
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:45,353
How much time do we have?

253
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,685
Tomorrow night,
6:00.

254
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,459
For 38 years,
this is on my hand.

255
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:56,795
Here.

256
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:01,771
Put it in the envelope,
Mrs. Rochon.

257
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,670
I will get my David back?

258
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,405
He's a good boy.

259
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:12,751
They have no business
taking him.

260
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,179
You are a good boy, too.

261
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,084
Your mother must be
very proud, Calel.

262
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,387
Good day.

263
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:22,389
Captain Szerynski, this is
the ring you wanted to see.

264
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:38,473
Hey!
What--

265
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,535
what's a pretty girl
like you doing here?

266
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,543
Same thing you're doing--
getting by.

267
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,445
Ha ha. But you're
not Jewish.

268
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,648
So why are you
in the ghetto?

269
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,580
But...I am.

270
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:54,154
I have to go
to the other side

271
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,356
to make money
for food.

272
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,690
Can you help me
get across?

273
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,797
I could.

274
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,799
But then I could cause myself
a lot of trouble.

275
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:09,642
This is the money from
captain Szerynski's men.

276
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:15,582
And this is
all you received?
Yes.

277
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,807
You counted it twice?

278
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:21,046
No.

279
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,280
3 times.

280
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:27,645
They're short.

281
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:28,487
I know.

282
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,691
They're 80,000 zlotys short.

283
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:33,463
I know!

284
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,463
Already 4:00.
Why didn't Szerynski call?

285
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:37,655
He said
he's doing his best.

286
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,470
Get me rabbi Lebowicz.

287
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,944
Come, rabbi, please.

288
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,745
Excuse me for
being so bold, sir,

289
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:03,187
but a rabbi should not go
into an establishment

290
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:04,562
of such ill repute.

291
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:06,858
Kazik.

292
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,103
In the Jewish faith,

293
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:22,167
it is customary that we
demonstrate our love of god

294
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,478
through our good deeds.

295
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,452
It is true.

296
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,621
And in this manner,

297
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,850
god is able to bestow his
great blessings upon us.

298
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,117
It is also true.

299
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:39,655
I believe today
you have a special duty

300
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:44,032
to demonstrate
your love of god.

301
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:46,933
Should you wish to do so,

302
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:49,096
preferably before 6 P.M...

303
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:55,576
Mr. Czerniakow...

304
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:01,010
I wish to thank you for
affording me this...

305
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:04,147
Special opportunity to
receive god's blessing.

306
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:12,562
Should you ever bring
your rabbi in my club again,

307
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:14,762
if you burst in
like this again,

308
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:16,664
I will kill you.

309
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:18,866
Make no mistake
about it.

310
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,681
Commissar Auerswald!

311
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,510
Commissar--

312
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:33,654
commissar Auerswald is
not here.

313
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,080
He must be here. He's
handling the Pawiak hostages.

314
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,775
There's a deadline, 6:00.

315
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:39,987
Commissar Auerswald
was called to Berlin

316
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,549
for important meetings.

317
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:42,818
Then who is in charge?

318
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:46,125
Please, do not stand
so close to my desk.

319
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,128
Who is in char--
I'm asking you...

320
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,400
Who--who is in charge?

321
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,269
I'm here to pay the full fine.
There is a deadline.

322
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:55,639
I know nothing about
this situation.

323
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,768
The commissar left no
instructions about this.

324
00:23:57,804 --> 00:24:00,244
Someone must know.
Who is handling this?

325
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,342
Step back from the desk!

326
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,214
I do not wish
your diseases.

327
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:07,353
This is the payment.
Call Pawiak prison.

328
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,349
Tell them the payment
has been delivered.

329
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:10,521
Did you say Pawiak?

330
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,980
Pawiak prison, yes.

331
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:13,318
23 hostages.

332
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:15,322
I saw a notice
on Pawiak.

333
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,864
Yes, here it is.

334
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:21,261
"On the authority
of the commissar's office,

335
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,603
"23 prisoners were...

336
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,300
"Executed
at 10:00 this morning

337
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:28,472
for crimes against
the Polish people."

338
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,239
No.

339
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:33,869
N...

340
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:40,052
Th-these were not crimes.
There were no crimes.

341
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,179
These were innocent people!

342
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,075
They were children.

343
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:47,217
You are with child.

344
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:49,393
Did you know
they were children?

345
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,391
I know nothing about
this situation.

346
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,894
If you wish to discuss
this with the commissar,

347
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,697
he will return
next Tuesday.

348
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:59,499
You are with child.
Have you no connection?

349
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:02,602
I have answered
your questions.

350
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:05,095
You are free to go now.

351
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,238
This morning, at 10:00,

352
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:15,108
the 23 hostages...

353
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:17,247
Were executed...

354
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:20,053
By order of
the commissar's office.

355
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:23,924
I am very sorry.

356
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:35,103
Uhh!

357
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:41,737
So you still don't want to
tell me who your comrades are?

358
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:43,544
Huh?!

359
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:46,176
Maybe I can be
more convincing.

360
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:53,551
Very convincing.

361
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,740
We've had 4,000 deaths
by starvation and typhus.

362
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,768
The population is now
approaching 450--

363
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,773
the Germans are now
rationing daily calories.

364
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:16,505
We're calculating
2,613 for German nationals,

365
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:20,012
699 for poles,
and 184 for Jews.

366
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:22,676
Auerswald's office has
ordered the Jewish council

367
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:26,145
to pay for all costs,
labor, and material

368
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:27,345
for this ghetto war.

369
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,456
I--I--I want you all
to know

370
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:33,688
that I do not believe
that our situation...

371
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:36,756
I do not believe it
to be hopeless.

372
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:40,226
I believe that
if we remain strong...

373
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,666
And active...

374
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:45,639
That somehow, some...

375
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:48,782
Sense of reason...

376
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:50,078
Will return. It's...

377
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,883
We--we must persevere.

378
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:16,373
Hey.

379
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:17,702
Wait. Wait!

380
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:20,637
Let me see what's
in your coat!

381
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:22,883
I don't have any bread.
I can see it.

382
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:24,709
I don't have anything.
Leave me alone.

383
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:26,254
I have money.

384
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:30,415
No!

385
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:32,649
First you give me
the bread.

386
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:44,926
Mira.

387
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:50,544
I can't believe
you're alive.

388
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:52,539
It's been so long.

389
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:54,041
Are you ok?

390
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:55,573
Yes. I'm fine.

391
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:58,679
Ooh. You're hur--

392
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:01,051
I'll take this.

393
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,480
How's my sister?

394
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,324
Gina's fine.

395
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,320
Do you want me
to wake her?

396
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,792
No, no, no.
Let her sleep.

397
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:11,491
Ooh. Are you sure
you don't need a doctor?

398
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,133
No, no. I just, uh,
I just need to rest.

399
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,358
Whew...

400
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,366
You weren't successful,
were you?

401
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,900
No.

402
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:28,011
Well, if we can't get to
Palestine and be farmers,

403
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,080
we'll stay here
and be fighters.

404
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:37,875
That's a fine way
to greet a friend.

405
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:39,887
I wouldn't do
that again.

406
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,189
Somebody else would shoot first
and ask questions later.

407
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,562
Duly noted.

408
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:47,631
So, kazik, what
could have made you

409
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,899
give up your fancy car
and join the resistance?

410
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:52,559
I can't think of a better
way to meet women.

411
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,568
Always the idealist, huh?

412
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:03,136
Ah, Yitzhak.

413
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:04,705
You look like crap.

414
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,783
Thank you.

415
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:07,112
But to be honest,

416
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:09,546
you were never really that
good-looking to begin with.

417
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,581
Thank you.

418
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,786
Don't worry.
You'll survive.

419
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:16,419
Yitzhak, I brought you
a little something.

420
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,785
A gift from my travels.

421
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:20,985
The first of many, I hope.

422
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,561
Here.

423
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,525
In case you run into
trouble again.

424
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:29,965
You and me, we're going
to put a stop to this, yes?

425
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:32,342
We've already begun to bring
together various factions

426
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,811
into a coherent
underground organization.

427
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:36,811
And the bund?
Are they with us?

428
00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:39,483
They're still
unconvinced.

429
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,951
We have so much to do
and little time to do it in.

430
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:45,082
We've organized our own
underground soup kitchens,

431
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,517
our own schools,
our own hospitals.

432
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:49,523
It's our own
little society.

433
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:52,555
We're just surrounded
by a brick wall.

434
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:53,891
What about the...

435
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:57,796
No. I've been unable to get you
a meeting with Czerniakow.

436
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,570
He refuses.

437
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:03,904
He refuses?

438
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,976
I don't see him, do you?

439
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:13,077
His car is there.

440
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:16,522
There with captain Szerynski
and that pest Calel Wasser.

441
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,048
He'll be here.

442
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,530
There he is.

443
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:43,208
Sir.

444
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,480
So you refuse
to meet my friend.

445
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:51,852
So, tell me,
my recently departed driver,

446
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:54,724
with whom am I
refusing to meet?

447
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:56,093
Mordechai Anielewicz.

448
00:30:56,122 --> 00:30:58,662
Oh, professor Ringelblum's
friend

449
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,860
who has an interesting
history.

450
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:02,963
Yeah. And an interest
in protecting our people.

451
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:05,625
And you think that
by lighting up flares

452
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:07,434
and having underground
meetings

453
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,636
and preparing resistance
against the Germans,

454
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,468
we'll accomplish this?

455
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:12,943
It's not what
I propose, sir.

456
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:15,172
We must strike back
in any way we can.

457
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,077
You're not worried
about the German doctrine

458
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:18,479
of collective responsibility?

459
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,310
Because what you are proposing
is spitting right in their eye,

460
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:23,447
and they will retaliate
against innocent Jews,

461
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:27,052
even harder than they did
in the last hostage crisis.

462
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:28,786
They suffer anyway.

463
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,820
Every day, they die of
disease and starvation,

464
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:32,656
and worse, and you sit
at the table,

465
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:35,091
you negotiate with these Germans
as if they're reasonable?

466
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:38,597
Yes, I do. I try to
minimize the harm.

467
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,530
Believe it or not,
so do we.

468
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:41,826
Please,
give us a chance.

469
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:44,267
Give us money and your
support to get started.

470
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:45,443
Your dream is a--

471
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:48,171
it's a romantic notion
that will get you all killed.

472
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:51,277
And I will not support it.
I will not.

473
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:54,210
And--and you should be
wearing a hat.

474
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,716
In this weather,
you can get pneumonia.

475
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,318
Good day.

476
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:15,195
And 5...

477
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:16,674
6...

478
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:18,202
7...

479
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:20,437
8...

480
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:21,942
Plie ...

481
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:23,984
And stretch...

482
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,420
5...6...

483
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,822
7...8...

484
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:41,429
1...2...3...4...

485
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,660
They're gone.

486
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:46,671
It's clear.

487
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:49,574
They're gone.

488
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:01,114
So you talked
to Czerniakow?

489
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:03,224
What did he say?

490
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:05,449
He said he won't
support us right now.

491
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:06,954
So what about later?

492
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,215
We're going to be
more persuasive.

493
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:13,026
Perhaps we can rendezvous
at the Copernicus statue tonight

494
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:16,529
and discuss your
views more fully.

495
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:19,302
There are many things that
we must talk about today.

496
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:22,401
It is our priority to find
more women couriers

497
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:25,804
who can pass as gentiles
and work on the Aryan side.

498
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,907
Why not men
who can pass?

499
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:28,969
Clara.

500
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,637
Men do not fare as well
in a strip search.

501
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,749
Circumcision.

502
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:37,377
Papa?

503
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:40,585
Papa?

504
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,490
I know you will think
it's dangerous,

505
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,492
but I have some
fresh bread for you.

506
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:55,195
Papa?

507
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:58,736
Papa?

508
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,218
Papa! Papa!

509
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:12,949
I have bread for you!

510
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:16,494
Fresh bread.

511
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:17,762
Papa.

512
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:20,488
Papa!

513
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:34,569
Amen.

514
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:42,106
* 1, 2, 3

515
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:44,978
* 1, 2, 3

516
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,429
So, you're ok here?

517
00:34:56,462 --> 00:34:58,062
Yes.

518
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,496
'Cause you can stay
with me. You know this.

519
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:01,832
It's fine with me.

520
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:07,613
You feel safer here,
don't you?

521
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,039
Yes.

522
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:10,384
It's true I'm afraid.

523
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:14,679
And if you were to be taken,
I would be alone.

524
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:19,892
You've been thinking
about this.

525
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,127
Go to class.
Go.

526
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:34,104
* 1, 2, 3

527
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:54,788
Dr. Korczak.

528
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,990
Uh, you have any luck convincing
Czerniakow to help us?

529
00:35:58,023 --> 00:35:59,363
No.

530
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,333
But come to our next
recital.

531
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:07,303
Yes. Jonah's
on Thursday.

532
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:09,943
Czerniakow
loves recitals.

533
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:11,698
Ah, ah, very good.

534
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:16,776
Tosia,
is this the child?

535
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:17,838
Yes.

536
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:20,546
You found her
near the cemetery?
That's correct.

537
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,009
And you lack the resources
to care for her?

538
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:24,348
I have nothing.

539
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:27,793
Hmm. This child
is not well.

540
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:32,719
Mrs. Linder, can we afford
to take another child?

541
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,785
We cannot.

542
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:39,298
We cannot take
another child.

543
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:41,971
But then,
we have no choice,

544
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,130
do we?

545
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,818
I want you
to meet my family.
Yes, sir.

546
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,158
My wife else.

547
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:06,329
Pleasure.

548
00:37:07,493 --> 00:37:11,403
This is Calel Wasser, one of
out finest young officers.

549
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,730
And this is
our daughter Inka.

550
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,408
We'll let you two
get acquainted.

551
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,712
It's a lovely house.

552
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,714
Thank you.

553
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:28,806
That ring...

554
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:32,617
Couldn't help but notice,
it's very unique.

555
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:33,821
Yes.

556
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:36,622
Have you had it long?

557
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:37,855
No.

558
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,389
Just since
my birthday.

559
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:42,025
And your father,
he gave it to you?

560
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,330
Yes.

561
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:44,702
How did you know?

562
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,630
Just a guess.

563
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:52,135
Uh...we just had reports...
That there were mass killings

564
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,370
in the village
where your parents live.

565
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:56,376
No one survived.

566
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:15,462
How about the rumor
that the gestapo

567
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:18,064
has offered you
a certificate to Palestine?

568
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:21,766
It is not a rumor.
It is the truth.

569
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,370
I refused.

570
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:29,167
I must thank you for the help
raising money for us.

571
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:32,237
I wish I could do more
for the children.

572
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:34,707
Well, then, by all means...

573
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:36,716
Do more.

574
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:01,739
Do not lose your temper.
Let me do the talking, ok?

575
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:02,843
You do
the talking.

576
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:03,884
Mr. chairman.

577
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:05,709
Mr. chairman.

578
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:07,954
You have received
our latest request?

579
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:10,819
Yes, I have received it.
You want to buy arms.

580
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,849
And the council...

581
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:14,885
They're aware.

582
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,460
And?

583
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:18,918
You want to buy guns.

584
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:20,687
And then what?

585
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:23,326
Jewish honor.

586
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,361
Jewish honor.

587
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:30,965
A father who is hiding
his son is not honorable.

588
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:34,442
A rabbi who is teaching
a child his lessons

589
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:35,913
is not honorable.

590
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:39,181
A mother who is taking care
of her children, and many more,

591
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,110
she is not honorable either.
No. For you...

592
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:45,947
Honor--honor can only come
out of the barrel of a gun.

593
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:48,324
You talk about Jewish honor.

594
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:52,263
I talk about
Jewish responsibility.

595
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,890
Call it what you like.

596
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:56,725
Will the council support
the resistance movement?

597
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:57,862
Oh, no, no.

598
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,296
They will oppose it,
it's for your own good.

599
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:03,571
What?! You've heard of
the mass killings, yes?

600
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:05,442
These are not rumors.

601
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:08,141
These are facts from the
mouths of our own people.

602
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:10,043
Outside of Chelmno,
thousands of Jews

603
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:15,405
were taken in sealed vans
with hoses pumping gas in.

604
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:18,717
I know this because
my parents were among them.

605
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,292
I'm sorry for your loss.

606
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:27,260
The largest armies
in the world

607
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:29,802
have not been able
to defeat the Nazis.

608
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:33,568
What makes you think that
a handful of untrained

609
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,699
Jewish citizens with pistols
will be the ones to prevail.

610
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:38,235
So instead of opposing
the Germans,

611
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,909
you propose to leave the fate of
our people in their very hands.

612
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,870
If you'll excuse me.

613
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:44,778
Mothers held their children
to their breasts

614
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,480
to protect them
from the gas.

615
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:48,752
When the Germans found
these babies still alive,

616
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,520
they would swing them
against trees to kill them.

617
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,520
Is that graphic
enough for you?

618
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:56,452
That's not the point.
That is the point.

619
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:59,218
Let's just salute,
huh?

620
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:01,487
Salute...

621
00:41:01,527 --> 00:41:02,787
Salute what?

622
00:41:02,828 --> 00:41:06,028
Your disciples, your followers,
your foot soldiers.

623
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:07,274
My what?

624
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,868
The one over there...
In the parade.

625
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:22,705
That's your honor...
Chairman.

626
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:00,694
Out!

627
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:01,849
Out!

628
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:06,216
Out!

629
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,457
It is an illegal gathering.

630
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:11,433
You are instructed
to return to your homes--

631
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:12,632
immediately.

632
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:15,034
Is this really necessary?

633
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:17,366
I struggle to find why
our recital

634
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:20,042
is injurious to
the third Reich.

635
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:22,971
I believe that
concludes today's program.

636
00:42:23,008 --> 00:42:27,648
Please join us tomorrow
for a very special salute

637
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:30,749
to Richard Wagner.
Good evening.

638
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:39,385
Jew!

639
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:40,964
Play something for us.

640
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:44,632
We have just been
instructed to go home.

641
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:46,833
I instruct you now.

642
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:49,329
Play something.

643
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:19,095
Aah! Aah!

644
00:43:27,873 --> 00:43:29,143
You...

645
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:30,384
Play something.

646
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:05,939
Kazik, grab the guns.

647
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,150
I'm sorry about your friend.

648
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:37,941
What do you
think you were doing?

649
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:39,706
I was avenging
a murder.

650
00:44:39,745 --> 00:44:41,345
But the Germans
will retaliate.

651
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:43,779
They do whatever
they want to, anyway.

652
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:49,715
This is not a responsible
fighting organization.

653
00:44:49,755 --> 00:44:51,555
Then we're not a responsible
fighting organization.

654
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:53,959
No, you! You must not
act impulsively.

655
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:56,832
We must carefully plan
and coordinate every act--

656
00:44:56,862 --> 00:44:59,062
I am tired, Yitzhak,
and I'm sick of it.

657
00:44:59,097 --> 00:45:01,727
Of watching and waiting and
standing by and being passive.

658
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:03,767
I won't do it anymore.
We're not passive!

659
00:45:03,802 --> 00:45:05,902
I won't do it anymore.
We're not passive!

660
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:08,307
Prudent in our actions.

661
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:11,479
You need to get weapons from
the Polish underground.

662
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:14,049
Arie needs all the help
he can get.

663
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,579
You will look after
my sister?
I will.

664
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:18,284
Go.

665
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:22,749
5, 6, 7, 8--

666
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,330
What is this?

667
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:01,858
Ah.

668
00:46:01,893 --> 00:46:04,903
You are Czerniakow,
chairman of the Jewish council?

669
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:05,730
Yes.

670
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,203
Yes, I'm Dr. Fritz Hippler

671
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:09,872
with the public information
office. Please, please.

672
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:11,871
Under the auspices
of secretary Goebbels

673
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:13,913
we are documenting
Jewish life in the ghetto,

674
00:46:13,939 --> 00:46:15,939
and we wish you to be
a participant.

675
00:46:15,974 --> 00:46:17,584
What do you
wish me to do?

676
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,648
Sit at your desk and conduct
your business as you would.

677
00:46:20,678 --> 00:46:21,808
Come over here, please.

678
00:46:21,847 --> 00:46:22,977
What is this?

679
00:46:23,014 --> 00:46:25,524
This makes
the picture look good.

680
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,350
I would not have that.

681
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:31,585
Good. Now,
I want you people to...

682
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,162
Talk and conduct business
as you would

683
00:46:34,192 --> 00:46:36,392
on any normal day.

684
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:37,797
Please, have a seat.

685
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:40,629
Are we ready? Yeah?

686
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:42,765
And roll camera, and...

687
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,270
Begin.

688
00:46:47,572 --> 00:46:48,712
Begin talking.

689
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:51,109
Ahem.

690
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,042
Yes, Nathan?

691
00:46:53,078 --> 00:46:55,478
Are you aware that
there is a rather large

692
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:57,883
candelabra on your desk?

693
00:46:57,916 --> 00:46:59,816
Yes, I know that.

694
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:03,116
Keep talking.

695
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:06,464
And are you aware that wax
is dripping all over your work?

696
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:07,731
Yes, I see that.

697
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:11,598
If I may ask, why would you have
a large candelabra on your desk

698
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:13,829
if it drips wax
all over your work?

699
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:15,765
They have it, Nathan,

700
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,770
because it is good
for the picture.

701
00:47:18,803 --> 00:47:20,113
Stop.

702
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:22,538
Stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop.
Just a moment, please.

703
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:26,579
Uh, the lighting
is all wrong.

704
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:27,981
Look,

705
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:31,253
this one has a perfectly good
Hebrew nose, and I can't see it.

706
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:37,222
Commissar Auerswald, there's
talk about deportations and, uh,

707
00:47:37,255 --> 00:47:39,555
putting to death
of people in the camps.

708
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:40,830
Just talk.

709
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,388
Uh-huh.
Rumors.

710
00:47:42,427 --> 00:47:43,997
I can assure you,

711
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:46,559
no truth to them
whatsoever.

712
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:47,597
Mm-hmm.

713
00:47:47,632 --> 00:47:49,432
Places, people.

714
00:47:51,102 --> 00:47:52,172
Please.

715
00:47:57,308 --> 00:47:59,948
Good, and would you
sit down, please.

716
00:47:59,978 --> 00:48:02,148
In your chair.
Could we see that?

717
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:05,781
Yes, that's much better.

718
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:09,816
Uh, there is--there is
one thing, though.

719
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:11,494
Um...

720
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:13,722
You're all being
very still.

721
00:48:13,758 --> 00:48:15,158
Uh, too still.

722
00:48:15,193 --> 00:48:18,033
Jewish people normally move
their hands when they talk,

723
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:21,233
so I want to see you move
your hands more, yes?

724
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:22,766
Let me see that.

725
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,700
Like this. Bigger.

726
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,666
And you...

727
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:30,205
Very good.
Yes, that's...

728
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:33,841
Something like that, yes.
Good. All right.

729
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:35,408
And roll camera...

730
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:40,416
And begin talking,
and use your hands.

731
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:41,821
Adam.
What?

732
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:43,922
Are you aware that there's
a large candelabra

733
00:48:43,955 --> 00:48:45,615
in the middle
of your desk?

734
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:47,056
Yes, Nathan.

735
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:50,932
You can rest assured
that I am fully aware

736
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:54,532
of all
that is transpiring.

737
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:01,907
The essential
trait of the Jew

738
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,609
is that he always tries
to hide his origin

739
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:06,612
when among non-Jews.

740
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:13,246
People, I want you
to work faster.

741
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:16,194
Wherever rats turn up.

742
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:18,191
They carry destruction
to the land

743
00:49:18,223 --> 00:49:20,793
in spreading
diseases and plagues,

744
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:24,725
just as the Jews do
among mankind.

745
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:28,702
This is a conspiracy
against all non-Jews

746
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:32,403
by a sick, deceitful,
poisoned race

747
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:36,237
against the Aryan peoples
and their moral laws.

748
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:39,483
Thank you,
Marek.

749
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:42,380
Enjoy your work,
but do it faster.

750
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:47,422
Remember, work...

751
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,715
Will make you free.

752
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:13,940
Come on, Sarah.

753
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:17,078
I have for you
2 work permits, all right?

754
00:50:17,115 --> 00:50:18,315
Listen to me.

755
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:21,419
The cards right here--
they will save your life.

756
00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:52,479
All Jews,

757
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:55,387
regardless of sex and age,
with certain exceptions,

758
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:59,060
are to be deported to work
camps in the east, by 4 P.M.

759
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,330
Commissar Auerswald.

760
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:02,888
Today we expect you to provide
the first contingent

761
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:05,197
of 6,000 people.

762
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,830
This will be
the minimum daily quota.

763
00:51:11,035 --> 00:51:13,065
And--and the children
in orphanages?

764
00:51:13,104 --> 00:51:15,344
Regardless
of sex and age.
Uh, perhaps--

765
00:51:15,373 --> 00:51:18,413
regardless
of sex and age.

766
00:51:18,443 --> 00:51:22,513
Lieutenant,
I am Adam Czerniakow.

767
00:51:22,547 --> 00:51:25,317
I'm the chairman
of the Jewish council.

768
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:28,620
I have been given assurances
at the highest level

769
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:31,423
concerning the treatment
of the children.

770
00:51:31,456 --> 00:51:35,356
I fully expect those
assurances to be honored.

771
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,799
Kindly sign
this proclamation.

772
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:46,295
I will not.

773
00:51:47,972 --> 00:51:50,342
Mr. Czerniakow,

774
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:53,235
if the deportation
is impeded in any way

775
00:51:53,278 --> 00:51:55,478
by you or your people,

776
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:58,323
the consequences
will be dire.

777
00:52:29,347 --> 00:52:31,147
This is the beginning
of an assault

778
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:33,052
on the existence
of the Jewish people.

779
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:35,893
So what do we do in
the face of this horror?

780
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,220
Do we--do we sit
on our hands and, uh,

781
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:41,086
wait for the next slap
in the face of the enemy...

782
00:52:47,265 --> 00:52:49,265
Or do we hide
within ourselves,

783
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,640
so that the blows
don't hurt us so much?

784
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:54,069
Or maybe we--we lift
our hands to god, huh,

785
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:56,074
and pray for
the Messiah to come?

786
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:57,836
Huh? Messiah,
are you coming?

787
00:52:57,875 --> 00:53:00,475
I--I don't think he's coming,
so what do we do?

788
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,611
We use our hands
and our arms

789
00:53:02,647 --> 00:53:04,877
and our hearts
and our lives and our deaths

790
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:08,515
and we fight back. We resist.
If you can't fight, then run.

791
00:53:08,553 --> 00:53:11,093
You can't run, then hide,
but you must resist...

792
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:12,761
Tosia!
You must.

793
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,120
Rachel!
Mama!

794
00:53:14,158 --> 00:53:15,358
Tosia!

795
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:17,193
Mama, show them
the permit!

796
00:53:17,228 --> 00:53:19,128
Tosia!
Show them!

797
00:53:19,163 --> 00:53:21,203
I didn't bring it! Aah!

798
00:53:21,232 --> 00:53:22,902
No!
Tosia!

799
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:24,673
Mama!

800
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,072
Tosia!

801
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:29,113
Aah! I want
to go with you!

802
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:32,379
Ah! Mama!

803
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:36,153
I want
to go with you!

804
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,780
Mama!

805
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:42,917
Those who are willing
to resist must work together.

806
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:45,893
We must share arms.
We must share information.

807
00:53:45,923 --> 00:53:47,733
Mordechai.
What?

808
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:49,728
You must leave for Warsaw.

809
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,760
What is it?

810
00:53:51,796 --> 00:53:54,326
We must leave...Now.

811
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,196
"They have asked me
to kill the children

812
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,165
"with my own hands.
This I cannot do.

813
00:54:01,205 --> 00:54:05,875
Signed,
Adam Czerniakow."

814
00:54:17,154 --> 00:54:18,624
Don't forget
your diaries.

815
00:54:18,656 --> 00:54:21,256
There will be plenty of time
to record your thoughts.

816
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,560
You said we had
15 minutes.

817
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:25,395
Out!

818
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:28,070
And we will
take our 15 minutes.

819
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,298
And when
we get to the camp,

820
00:54:30,335 --> 00:54:32,695
we will all get to see

821
00:54:32,737 --> 00:54:38,277
the most beautiful pine
trees and birch trees,

822
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:41,409
and if there
are beautiful trees,

823
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:43,176
what else will we see?

824
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:44,213
Birds.

825
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:45,678
Birds, yes.

826
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:48,186
That's right. That's
right, but what else?

827
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:49,348
Rabbits?

828
00:54:49,387 --> 00:54:53,087
Yes, yes. Very good.
Very good, yes. And?

829
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,123
Squirrels.

830
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:57,058
Squirrels.
Very good, Jan.

831
00:54:57,094 --> 00:55:00,034
Many,
many squirrels.

832
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:03,534
Uh, and don't
forget the flag.

833
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,820
* almost ready

834
00:55:23,854 --> 00:55:26,164
* there will be many
adventures here *

835
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:28,330

* forward walk,
forward bravely *

840
00:55:40,638 --> 00:55:43,908
don't let them know
that you are afraid.

841
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:45,841
Don't let them know.

842
00:55:45,876 --> 00:55:47,476
* 1, 2, 3

843
00:55:47,512 --> 00:55:49,912

* 1, 2, 3,
1, 2, 3 *

845
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:55,250
do your friends in the bund
still have contact

846
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:57,485
with the railway
workers?

847
00:55:57,522 --> 00:55:59,462
Yes.

848
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:01,960
Can you make it out
of the ghetto again?

849
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:03,232
I can try.

850
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,230
Go, Zygmunt.
Follow the trains,

851
00:56:05,262 --> 00:56:07,602
and tell us definitively
where they are going.

852
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,410
* 1, 2, 3

853
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,540

* 1, 2, 3

860
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:51,279
Sir, please. I am separated
from my wife and children.

861
00:56:51,308 --> 00:56:54,748
Can I have a minute to find them
and board the train together?

862
00:56:54,779 --> 00:56:56,979
On the train.
No, no, sir,
please. Please.

863
00:56:57,014 --> 00:56:59,084
Take these.

864
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:02,946
They are worth a lot. Just give
me a minute. Please, I beg you.

865
00:57:02,987 --> 00:57:05,557
On the train!

866
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:07,160
On the train!

880
00:57:54,338 --> 00:57:56,808
Dr. Korczak,
why are you here?

881
00:57:56,841 --> 00:57:59,011
You're exempt
from this order.

882
00:57:59,043 --> 00:58:00,583
What about
the children?

883
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:03,251
The children must
board the train.

884
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,450
Then I will do as well.

885
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,322
You must not do this.

886
00:58:07,351 --> 00:58:09,851
I won't allow you
on the train.

887
00:58:09,887 --> 00:58:13,587
Well, then kill me here and now
in front of the children.

888
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:24,543
Don't lemme go!
Lemme stay with you!

889
00:58:24,569 --> 00:58:26,769
I'll be safe! Don't lemme
go with my parents!

890
00:58:26,804 --> 00:58:29,814
Please! I'll be safe with you.
Don't let them take me--

891
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,780
get off!

892
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:33,839
Don't let them
take me away!

893
00:58:33,878 --> 00:58:36,048
Don't let them
take me away!

894
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:29,634
What is it?
Where are we going?

895
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:31,967
Marek said
they want workers...

896
00:59:32,002 --> 00:59:35,212
But they're not
taking cripples.

897
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:37,239
It's your only chance.

898
00:59:37,274 --> 00:59:38,644
Nurse!

899
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:41,146
Quickly, now, quickly,
before the guards return!

900
00:59:44,148 --> 00:59:46,118
Ok, it's your
only chance.

901
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,150
Oh, but I'm
a dancer.

902
00:59:52,356 --> 00:59:54,826
Clara,
hold your breath.

903
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:53,851
Gina was taken
to the camps.

904
01:00:59,724 --> 01:01:02,934
Zygmunt is back
from Treblinka.

905
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:17,069
Zygmunt.

906
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:19,977
It's Mordechai. Can you
tell us what you saw?

907
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,353
Zygmunt.

908
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:28,122
Collect yourself
and tell us.

909
01:01:30,454 --> 01:01:34,964
Children, women,
by the thousands,

910
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:39,956
gassed to death
in showers.

911
01:01:39,997 --> 01:01:42,467
They can hide
everything,

912
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:46,799
but not the stench
of the dead.

913
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:49,637
This is the map
of the camp of death.

914
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:52,043
This is the map
of Treblinka.

915
01:01:58,816 --> 01:02:01,346
And the people
pleading for their lives

916
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:03,215
with this scum.

917
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:07,223
This scum--I want
their blood on my hands.

918
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:13,161
We know that
Adam Czerniakow

919
01:02:13,197 --> 01:02:15,597
has committed suicide.

920
01:02:15,632 --> 01:02:19,772
We now know that
300,000 Warsaw Jews

921
01:02:19,804 --> 01:02:22,474
have been either sent
to Treblinka, a death camp,

922
01:02:22,506 --> 01:02:24,666
or have simply
been murdered.

923
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:27,208
For now, the deportations
have ceased.

924
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:30,924
They're going to resume, when
they do, we'll no longer submit.

925
01:02:30,948 --> 01:02:34,918
We are going to respond
with armed resistance.

926
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:38,587
We have to use
this time wisely

927
01:02:38,622 --> 01:02:40,262
to root out traitors
and collaborators,

928
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:42,490
to acquire weapons,
to prepare a plan of battle,

929
01:02:42,526 --> 01:02:45,726
most importantly, to let all
those who remain in the ghetto

930
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:49,502
know that we can and we will
fight our enemy now

931
01:02:49,533 --> 01:02:52,373
with all the Jewish groups
finally under one banner

932
01:02:52,402 --> 01:02:54,872
with one purpose.

933
01:02:54,905 --> 01:02:57,735
Perhaps we can save some lives
and remove a few Germans

934
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,984
from the face of the earth.
But this much,

935
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:01,910
this much I promise you.

936
01:03:01,946 --> 01:03:05,676
We will live with honor...

937
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:07,885
And we will die with honor.

938
01:03:10,254 --> 01:03:12,024
Jewish honor.

939
01:03:12,656 --> 01:03:15,526
I'm--I'm ashamed

940
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:17,089
of...

941
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:20,657
Of what
I've been party to.

942
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:22,627
I'm a lawyer
by training.

943
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:27,796
I just wanted to save my family,
to survive like everyone else.

944
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:30,008
Now, I'm...

945
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,280
I'm ashamed
to wear my uniform.

946
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,509
You should be ashamed.

947
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,981
Stop it. Stop crying
like a child.

948
01:03:40,784 --> 01:03:42,324
I don't trust him.

949
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,222
Send him on a mission.

950
01:03:47,257 --> 01:03:48,387
I don't trust him.

951
01:03:48,425 --> 01:03:49,625
Send him on a mission,

952
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,999
and then we'll see
which side he's on.

953
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:54,129
Zachariah
will observe him.

954
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,074
If he fails,
we'll execute him,

955
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,700
like the others
who have been

956
01:03:57,734 --> 01:04:00,574
exceptionally cruel
to their own people.

957
01:04:00,604 --> 01:04:02,444
If he succeeds,
keep him in uniform.

958
01:04:02,472 --> 01:04:05,412
It could prove useful to have a
policeman working for us.

959
01:04:05,442 --> 01:04:08,082
We want you to go undercover
to the Aryan side

960
01:04:08,112 --> 01:04:09,912
to smuggle weapons
into the ghetto.

961
01:04:09,947 --> 01:04:11,617
Are you willing
to do that?

962
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:13,418
Yes.
Good.

963
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:17,120
She has no family anymore.
There's no one left.

964
01:04:17,154 --> 01:04:20,224
This is a map
of Treblinka.

965
01:04:20,257 --> 01:04:24,487
Get it to one of our couriers,
and it must travel to England.

966
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:26,928
Do you
see your name?

967
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:29,698
Viescha.

968
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:32,273
Viescha Sovitska.

969
01:04:32,302 --> 01:04:34,142
Viescha Sovitska.

970
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:37,341
You are to hide this map
inside your shoe.

971
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:39,114
Do you understand?

972
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:59,100
Do you know
what night this is?

973
01:04:59,129 --> 01:05:00,759
No.

974
01:05:00,797 --> 01:05:04,627
I think it might be
Friday night.

975
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:07,668
We didn't light
the sabbath candles.

976
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,479
I don't have any
sabbath candles.

977
01:05:17,147 --> 01:05:19,177
Good night.

978
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:20,446
Good night.

979
01:05:24,888 --> 01:05:27,458
I forgot
to ask your name.

980
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,559
It's viescha.

981
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:34,496
And you are?

982
01:05:34,531 --> 01:05:36,871
Frania.

983
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,500
Good night,
frania.

984
01:05:50,514 --> 01:05:55,854
Boruch ata adonai...

985
01:05:55,885 --> 01:06:01,985
Eloheinu melech haolam...

986
01:06:02,026 --> 01:06:04,886
Asher kideshanu

987
01:06:04,928 --> 01:06:08,298
b'mitzvotav...

988
01:06:08,332 --> 01:06:12,602
V'etzivanu...

989
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:15,866
L'hadlikner...

990
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:19,375
L'hadlikner...

991
01:06:19,409 --> 01:06:23,379
Shel shabbat.

992
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:27,154
I say that we just go out
in broad daylight

993
01:06:27,184 --> 01:06:29,224
and we shoot
as many as we can.

994
01:06:29,253 --> 01:06:31,563
Forget dying in a Blaze
of glory, Mira.

995
01:06:31,588 --> 01:06:34,388
Why give them the satisfaction
and make it easy on them?

996
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:37,034
I still think we should
wait as long as possible

997
01:06:37,061 --> 01:06:39,161
so we can acquire more
weapons and train.

998
01:06:39,196 --> 01:06:40,996
No, Yitzhak.
What we have to do

999
01:06:41,031 --> 01:06:43,131
is we've to organize
escape to the woods.

1000
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:45,597
Create a larger organization and
fight from outside the ghetto.

1001
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:48,365
No, no, no. We'll never
make it on the outside.

1002
01:06:48,405 --> 01:06:50,635
We'll be sold out.
We'll be informed on.

1003
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:52,144
We'll be slaughtered.

1004
01:06:52,176 --> 01:06:54,336
I think we should
take them all hostage

1005
01:06:54,378 --> 01:06:57,008
and make them listen to German
folk music, really loud,

1006
01:06:57,047 --> 01:06:59,447
until they lose their minds
and they give up.

1007
01:06:59,483 --> 01:07:00,853
This is serious.

1008
01:07:00,884 --> 01:07:02,694
Every day of peace
in the ghetto

1009
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:04,319
is another day
that we can prepare

1010
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:06,294
for the organized attack
of the future.

1011
01:07:06,323 --> 01:07:10,193
We need to send a series of
messages to the Jewish police,

1012
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:11,357
to the Jewish council,

1013
01:07:11,395 --> 01:07:13,355
to our own people
in the ghetto,

1014
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:16,397
to the Nazis, and we need
to do it now, Yitzhak.

1015
01:07:16,433 --> 01:07:17,503
We can't wait.

1016
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:20,144
They've to know who we are
and we mean business,

1017
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:21,970
even if it means
using up, uh...

1018
01:07:22,005 --> 01:07:24,205
All the weapons.
Yes, even if
it means this.

1019
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:26,741
Then we just
have to pray.
For what?

1020
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:29,806
For what? For tosia to get
the map out of the ghetto,

1021
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:33,216
and for she and arie to smuggle
more weapons back in.

1022
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:00,437
Unh! Oh!

1023
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:07,822
Hey! Hey!

1024
01:08:07,851 --> 01:08:10,591
Go in the shack.

1025
01:08:11,888 --> 01:08:13,458
Come on.

1026
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:15,190
Go in the shack.

1027
01:08:32,075 --> 01:08:33,575
Place of work?

1028
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,880
Schmidt foundry.

1029
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:37,852
Location?
Chmielna 2.

1030
01:08:40,016 --> 01:08:42,186
Give me your coat
and dress.

1031
01:08:52,762 --> 01:08:54,502
Now the rest.

1032
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:07,635
You want this, too?

1033
01:09:12,949 --> 01:09:14,679
Shoes.

1034
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,474
I said shoes.

1035
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:46,623
Do you want me
to use this?

1036
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:12,513
Another one.

1037
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:13,982
Another one!

1038
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:25,153
A Jew has escaped!

1039
01:10:25,188 --> 01:10:27,488
We must capture
him now! Quickly!

1040
01:10:32,696 --> 01:10:36,526
Get dressed. Get out
of here. Quickly.

1041
01:10:42,205 --> 01:10:43,635
Hey! Where are
you going?

1042
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:45,913
To work. I just
passed my inspection.

1043
01:11:06,663 --> 01:11:09,373
Hey, Jew, what
are you selling today?

1044
01:11:21,144 --> 01:11:22,954
How close are we
to the plant?

1045
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:25,979
A couple of blocks.
You're lucky.

1046
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:27,415
Lucky?

1047
01:11:27,451 --> 01:11:29,651
Most people that go
to that guard shack

1048
01:11:29,686 --> 01:11:30,846
don't come out.

1049
01:11:32,822 --> 01:11:33,822
I think this is where

1050
01:11:33,857 --> 01:11:36,257
you take your
armband off and leave us.

1051
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,562
Are you going
to turn me in?

1052
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:41,670
No.

1053
01:12:00,684 --> 01:12:03,094
Viescha.
Viescha, it's kazik.

1054
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:04,919
I couldn't get close
to the gate.

1055
01:12:04,954 --> 01:12:06,364
It wasn't safe.

1056
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:10,990
So I had to follow
the wagon. Come, walk.

1057
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:12,627
Walk. It's all right.

1058
01:12:20,937 --> 01:12:22,437
Blackmailers up ahead.

1059
01:12:22,472 --> 01:12:24,672
We need to laugh.

1060
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:26,038
Laugh?

1061
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:28,905
Yes. Jews look down.

1062
01:12:28,945 --> 01:12:30,045
Jews look sad.

1063
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:32,149
Jews avert their eyes.

1064
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:34,021
Blackmailers
can smell fear,

1065
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:35,390
so, can you laugh?

1066
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:37,990
Try again.

1067
01:12:40,557 --> 01:12:42,357
Try to do it big
like this.

1068
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:47,004
I said sleep,
not sheep.

1069
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:48,700
Sleep.

1070
01:12:48,732 --> 01:12:49,872
Not bad.

1071
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,470
Keep practicing.

1072
01:13:16,426 --> 01:13:18,796
Viescha, this
is Michael Klepflisch.

1073
01:13:18,828 --> 01:13:20,098
Hi.
Hello.

1074
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:21,129
Nice to meet you.

1075
01:13:21,164 --> 01:13:22,174
Arie Wilmer.

1076
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:23,598
We've met.

1077
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:26,643
Get to know
them both well.

1078
01:13:33,877 --> 01:13:35,477
So, he was good.

1079
01:13:43,553 --> 01:13:45,153
I wanted
to arrange a meeting

1080
01:13:45,188 --> 01:13:47,088
with your boss,
Szerynsky.

1081
01:13:47,123 --> 01:13:49,263
You can accomplish this?

1082
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:52,062
Yes.

1083
01:13:52,095 --> 01:13:53,995
Good.

1084
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,770
I'm sorry if it's...

1085
01:13:58,802 --> 01:14:01,202
It's been in my shoe
for a couple days.

1086
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:04,437
No. It gives it
character.

1087
01:14:04,474 --> 01:14:08,284
Do you realize that
this map of Treblinka

1088
01:14:08,311 --> 01:14:09,881
will travel
by special courier

1089
01:14:09,913 --> 01:14:12,723
all the way to the prime
minister Churchill himself?

1090
01:14:12,749 --> 01:14:14,549
With the other documents
he will carry,

1091
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:16,454
hopefully, it will
persuade the allies

1092
01:14:16,486 --> 01:14:18,286
to give us
the weapons we need

1093
01:14:18,321 --> 01:14:20,461
to bomb the German trains

1094
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:23,560
and hopefully even
the death camps themselves.

1095
01:14:23,593 --> 01:14:25,733
Do you understand now?

1096
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:30,066
Yes.

1097
01:15:15,779 --> 01:15:18,679
Come on, Zach!
Zygmunt, let's go!

1098
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:26,561
Captain Szerynski?

1099
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:28,390
I have a message for you

1100
01:15:28,424 --> 01:15:30,264
from the Jewish
fighting organization.

1101
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:31,293
For your traitorous
activities

1102
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:32,727
and for collaboration
with the enemy,

1103
01:15:32,762 --> 01:15:35,362
you have been tried
in a court of your people

1104
01:15:35,398 --> 01:15:36,998
and have been
condemned to death.

1105
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,073
Good-bye.

1106
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:39,671
Good-bye?

1107
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:41,613
Aah!

1108
01:15:47,243 --> 01:15:48,513
Is it too heavy?

1109
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,354
It's all right.
I can carry it,

1110
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:51,819
but what if it
gets dropped?

1111
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:55,478
You wouldn't want
to drop dynamite.

1112
01:15:55,518 --> 01:15:58,088
No, but what
if something falls?

1113
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:02,259
You wouldn't want
something to fall.

1114
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:03,561
It could get bumped.

1115
01:16:03,593 --> 01:16:05,563
Bumped could be ok.

1116
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:08,063
Good work.

1117
01:16:08,097 --> 01:16:09,097
Good shooting.

1118
01:16:09,132 --> 01:16:10,372
Good job, Calel.

1119
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,569
Calel,
welcome.

1120
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,372
Welcome to the family,
Calel.

1121
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,644
Now the Germans
will come to us, yeah?

1122
01:16:50,707 --> 01:16:53,777
Hey, lady, wait.
Hold on.

1123
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,160
Thank you.

1124
01:17:12,195 --> 01:17:13,695
Let's go quickly,
lady.

1125
01:17:16,332 --> 01:17:18,532
Steady...

1126
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:19,567
Aim...

1127
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:20,602
Fire!

1128
01:17:21,805 --> 01:17:23,205
Good, good.
Remember,

1129
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:24,539
one round,
one German.

1130
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:26,513
No wasted
rounds, yeah?

1131
01:17:26,542 --> 01:17:27,842
Ok. Front row
kneels.

1132
01:17:27,877 --> 01:17:30,207
All right.
Steady...

1133
01:17:30,246 --> 01:17:31,876
Tosia.

1134
01:17:31,915 --> 01:17:32,715
Viescha.

1135
01:17:32,749 --> 01:17:33,819
It's all right.

1136
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:35,050
You're
with friends here.

1137
01:17:35,084 --> 01:17:36,224
Thanks.

1138
01:17:36,252 --> 01:17:37,252
Steady,
aim, fire!

1139
01:17:38,321 --> 01:17:40,791
Good, and steady...

1140
01:17:42,025 --> 01:17:43,155
Mordechai.

1141
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:43,992
Yeah?

1142
01:17:44,027 --> 01:17:45,357
Tosia's brought
some gifts.

1143
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:46,864
Ah, perfect timing.

1144
01:17:46,896 --> 01:17:48,726
Good. When can we
expect more?

1145
01:17:48,765 --> 01:17:49,965
Arie said there will be

1146
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,599
another shipment
momentarily.

1147
01:17:51,634 --> 01:17:53,304
He will smuggle them
personally.

1148
01:17:53,336 --> 01:17:54,466
Good. Good.

1149
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:57,013
Steady...

1150
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,140
Aim, fire!

1151
01:17:59,575 --> 01:18:01,635
Devorah, I said aim.

1152
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,607
Yes, very important
to aim.

1153
01:18:03,646 --> 01:18:06,516
Arguably almost as
important as firing itself.

1154
01:18:06,549 --> 01:18:09,989
Shira, see if you can
help Devorah to aim.

1155
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:11,419
Frania.

1156
01:18:15,158 --> 01:18:16,188
Marek.

1157
01:18:16,225 --> 01:18:17,655
Oh!

1158
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,133
Look what tosia's
brought us.

1159
01:18:19,162 --> 01:18:21,662
Zivia, please,
a good rule of thumb--

1160
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:24,197
never to pat
the bomb-maker on the back

1161
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:25,773
while he's working. Ok?

1162
01:18:25,802 --> 01:18:27,442
Ah, what's this?

1163
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:30,268
Ohh!

1164
01:18:30,306 --> 01:18:31,506
Dynamite.

1165
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,210
Excellent.

1166
01:18:33,242 --> 01:18:34,312
I also need--

1167
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:37,678
Potassium chloride.

1168
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,183
I also need--

1169
01:18:40,884 --> 01:18:43,154
Bottles.
Can you get me those?

1170
01:18:43,186 --> 01:18:44,786
Yes, I'll try.

1171
01:18:45,588 --> 01:18:47,588
I also need a new
set of lungs.

1172
01:18:47,623 --> 01:18:48,893
Marek used to work

1173
01:18:48,925 --> 01:18:50,525
in the lab
at the hospital.

1174
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:51,659
This is more fun.

1175
01:18:51,694 --> 01:18:54,164
Uhh, anything else,
Mr. engineer?

1176
01:18:54,197 --> 01:18:55,357
More.

1177
01:18:55,398 --> 01:18:57,398
Just more
of everything.

1178
01:18:57,433 --> 01:18:58,973
More.

1179
01:18:59,002 --> 01:19:00,772
You all are
under arrest!

1180
01:19:00,804 --> 01:19:02,944
Put down your bombs
and return immediately

1181
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:04,772
to the umschlagplatz!

1182
01:19:04,808 --> 01:19:06,108
Heil Hitler!

1183
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:20,917
So that would bring us
here, right?

1184
01:19:22,391 --> 01:19:23,531
Kazik.

1185
01:19:23,559 --> 01:19:25,259
Who's that girl
with the pistol?

1186
01:19:25,294 --> 01:19:26,764
That's Devorah Baron.

1187
01:19:26,796 --> 01:19:30,566
She's with Marek and Gutman,
at the brushmaker's.

1188
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:31,799
That is
such a coincidence.

1189
01:19:31,835 --> 01:19:33,135
I was thinking that

1190
01:19:33,169 --> 01:19:34,969
I should be stationed
at the brushmaker's.

1191
01:19:35,004 --> 01:19:37,774
Don't you agree, boss?

1192
01:19:56,359 --> 01:19:57,959
Heil Hitler!
Heil Hitler!

1193
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:02,326
Intelligence estimates
that there are only

1194
01:20:02,365 --> 01:20:06,295
30 to 40,000 left,
Reichsfuhrer Himmler.

1195
01:20:06,335 --> 01:20:08,165
I'm disappointed,
colonel Von Sammern.

1196
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:10,974
There are so many!

1197
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,537
They sabotaged
our factories.

1198
01:20:12,575 --> 01:20:14,235
They attacked
our soldiers.

1199
01:20:14,277 --> 01:20:15,277
There.

1200
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:17,581
And there.
Look. See?

1201
01:20:17,613 --> 01:20:20,823
And another.

1202
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:23,020
Don't we have an understanding,
colonel Von Sammern,

1203
01:20:23,052 --> 01:20:25,222
that I can rely on you

1204
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:28,294
to make sure that Warsaw's
free of these vermin?

1205
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:30,134
Absolutely.

1206
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:47,378
Into the blockade.
We are surrounded.

1207
01:20:48,912 --> 01:20:50,712
Mordechai! Mordechai!

1208
01:20:50,746 --> 01:20:52,376
Into the blockade.
We are surrounded.

1209
01:20:52,415 --> 01:20:54,845
All right, all right.
Let's go. Let's go!

1210
01:20:54,884 --> 01:20:55,894
Guns up here!

1211
01:20:55,919 --> 01:20:57,689
Do it. Do it!

1212
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,760
Marek!

1213
01:21:02,959 --> 01:21:04,629
Don't forget the ammo.

1214
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:06,130
Go with kazik!

1215
01:21:06,162 --> 01:21:07,762
Clara, let's go.
Clara, come on!

1216
01:21:37,193 --> 01:21:38,693
Get in line!

1217
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,497
Get in the line,
I said!

1218
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:58,910
Look straight!

1219
01:22:36,085 --> 01:22:39,215
Up here!
There are Jews inside!

1220
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:58,770
Wo sind sie?

1221
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,137
They're inside.

1222
01:23:00,176 --> 01:23:01,576
Here!

1223
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:05,380
Aus!

1224
01:23:20,129 --> 01:23:22,229
Look out! Move!

1225
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:24,999
Look out!

1226
01:23:26,035 --> 01:23:28,035
Look out!

1227
01:23:28,071 --> 01:23:29,711
Look out! Look out!

1228
01:23:37,313 --> 01:23:38,853
Aah!

1229
01:23:49,325 --> 01:23:50,585
Aah!

1230
01:24:05,674 --> 01:24:07,384
Come on!
Come and get me!

1231
01:24:09,612 --> 01:24:11,052
Come and get me!

1232
01:24:15,017 --> 01:24:16,217
Come on!

1233
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:19,821
Come on.

1234
01:24:19,855 --> 01:24:20,855
Get out of here!

1235
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,259
Yitzhak!

1236
01:24:22,291 --> 01:24:23,991
Come on.
It's enough! Let's go!

1237
01:24:24,026 --> 01:24:25,156
No!

1238
01:24:25,194 --> 01:24:27,164
Let's go!
Now!

1239
01:24:27,196 --> 01:24:28,426
We will fight
later!

1240
01:24:28,464 --> 01:24:30,274
Come on! Now!

1241
01:24:30,299 --> 01:24:32,399
Yitzhak, he's dead.
Come!

1242
01:24:32,435 --> 01:24:33,735
Please!

1243
01:24:35,104 --> 01:24:37,074
Get him off.

1244
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:40,908
Enough!

1245
01:24:40,943 --> 01:24:42,283
All right.
Let's go.

1246
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:43,851
Grab the guns
and ammunition.

1247
01:24:43,879 --> 01:24:45,679
Hurry!
Grab the guns!

1248
01:24:53,856 --> 01:24:55,316
For the first time,

1249
01:24:55,358 --> 01:24:56,958
we have stopped
the deportations.

1250
01:24:56,992 --> 01:24:58,492
For the first time,

1251
01:24:58,527 --> 01:25:01,457
the enemy knows
who we are, as a people.

1252
01:25:01,497 --> 01:25:03,267
They know that
we will resist.

1253
01:25:03,299 --> 01:25:05,099
They know that
we will fight back.

1254
01:25:05,134 --> 01:25:07,304
They know that
they're going to pay

1255
01:25:07,336 --> 01:25:08,496
for their mass murder.

1256
01:25:08,537 --> 01:25:10,337
What they don't know
is how long

1257
01:25:10,373 --> 01:25:11,973
and how hard
and how successfully

1258
01:25:12,007 --> 01:25:13,277
we are going to battle.

1259
01:25:13,309 --> 01:25:16,109
In fact, we are going to
light a torch of resistance,

1260
01:25:16,145 --> 01:25:18,105
and it's going to burn
so brightly

1261
01:25:18,147 --> 01:25:20,547
that others everywhere
are going to be inspired

1262
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:22,293
to resist as well.

1263
01:25:25,188 --> 01:25:33,058
For Stosh, for Michael,
for Leon, for Ariel,

1264
01:25:33,095 --> 01:25:34,395
for Zvi...

1265
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,930
And for Clara,

1266
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,567
who sacrificed
their lives

1267
01:25:41,604 --> 01:25:43,214
for our dignity,

1268
01:25:43,239 --> 01:25:45,769
a moment, please,
of reflection

1269
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:47,808
and of silence.

1270
01:27:34,116 --> 01:27:36,246
I have good news
to report.

1271
01:27:36,285 --> 01:27:39,315
Faced with ferocious
Jewish resistance,

1272
01:27:39,355 --> 01:27:41,315
the Germans
have surrendered.

1273
01:27:41,357 --> 01:27:42,887
Hitler has
apologized

1274
01:27:42,925 --> 01:27:44,885
for all
the inconvenience.

1275
01:27:44,927 --> 01:27:46,257
The Jews have won.

1276
01:27:46,295 --> 01:27:48,255
I should notify
the allies.

1277
01:27:48,297 --> 01:27:49,297
What for?

1278
01:27:49,332 --> 01:27:51,502
What have they
done for us?

1279
01:27:55,538 --> 01:27:57,838
My favorite thing
about the zoo

1280
01:27:57,873 --> 01:27:59,343
is the animals.

1281
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:01,475
They're not going
to turn you in.

1282
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:03,680
What about telling
that Polish monkey

1283
01:28:03,712 --> 01:28:04,852
over there?

1284
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,650
Oh, no. He's ok.

1285
01:28:06,682 --> 01:28:08,982
He used to date
my cousin Ida.

1286
01:28:12,087 --> 01:28:14,287
This letter goes
to Klepflisch

1287
01:28:14,323 --> 01:28:16,493
as soon as you leave.

1288
01:28:20,262 --> 01:28:21,932
Follow my lead.

1289
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,536
Sorry.

1290
01:28:31,607 --> 01:28:33,237
I was...

1291
01:28:33,275 --> 01:28:35,435
Just being protective.

1292
01:28:36,111 --> 01:28:37,411
Arie...

1293
01:28:37,446 --> 01:28:39,416
If you'd like to be
my boyfriend,

1294
01:28:39,448 --> 01:28:42,278
that's all right
with me.

1295
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,347
You know I'll be
going on these missions,

1296
01:28:44,387 --> 01:28:45,787
and if I don't
come back,

1297
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:48,721
I'd like somebody to know
that I didn't come back.

1298
01:28:53,128 --> 01:28:54,428
Stop!

1299
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:59,774
Sir, this man died
on the Aryan side.

1300
01:28:59,802 --> 01:29:02,812
I have orders to take him
to the Jewish cemetery.

1301
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:04,808
What's in the box?

1302
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:07,710
A Jew named Izzy.

1303
01:29:07,743 --> 01:29:09,343
Open it.

1304
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:11,979
The casket?

1305
01:29:12,014 --> 01:29:13,754
Open it now!

1306
01:29:14,316 --> 01:29:15,976
All right, sir.

1307
01:29:18,787 --> 01:29:20,457
Unh!

1308
01:29:32,067 --> 01:29:34,467
Get that thing
away from here!

1309
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:37,474
Yes, sir.

1310
01:29:39,174 --> 01:29:41,044
Good work, Izzy.

1311
01:29:41,076 --> 01:29:43,376
You really are
a very good stinker.

1312
01:29:50,853 --> 01:29:53,393
Did arie say anything?

1313
01:29:53,422 --> 01:29:56,662
He said there were
more on the way.

1314
01:29:56,692 --> 01:29:58,132
But for now,

1315
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:00,860
50 pistols
and 2 rifles.

1316
01:30:06,569 --> 01:30:08,539
But now I must attempt

1317
01:30:08,571 --> 01:30:10,741
an even more important
mission.

1318
01:30:12,374 --> 01:30:13,484
Procreation.

1319
01:30:13,509 --> 01:30:15,309
So that the fuhrer
has one more

1320
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:17,183
ghetto fighter
to deal with.

1321
01:30:17,212 --> 01:30:19,182
Attempt is the right word.

1322
01:30:30,058 --> 01:30:32,058
My father-in-law,
he said,

1323
01:30:32,094 --> 01:30:34,534
"study hard.
Get a degree,

1324
01:30:34,563 --> 01:30:37,533
so you won't have
to dig ditches."

1325
01:30:37,566 --> 01:30:39,326
The home army is
very impressed

1326
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:41,037
with our actions.

1327
01:30:42,137 --> 01:30:44,207
It's just a start.

1328
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:46,439
I hope.

1329
01:30:46,475 --> 01:30:48,635
Throw it quickly!
Quickly!

1330
01:31:14,903 --> 01:31:16,043
Ohh!

1331
01:31:43,131 --> 01:31:44,771
Aah!

1332
01:31:52,608 --> 01:31:55,278
Look! Look, you both
want to stay and fight,

1333
01:31:55,310 --> 01:31:56,550
fine.

1334
01:31:56,579 --> 01:31:58,679
But what are you
going to fight with?

1335
01:31:58,714 --> 01:32:00,084
One of you must go.

1336
01:32:00,115 --> 01:32:02,215
Arie's sources are
probably in hiding,

1337
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:03,350
terrified he might talk.

1338
01:32:03,385 --> 01:32:04,485
Arie won't talk.

1339
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:06,519
Arie won't talk.
Arie will not talk.

1340
01:32:06,555 --> 01:32:07,585
He won't talk, zivia.

1341
01:32:07,623 --> 01:32:08,823
We know that.
They don't.

1342
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:10,457
Kazik, can we get him out?

1343
01:32:10,492 --> 01:32:11,832
It's difficult.

1344
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:12,660
Can we do it?

1345
01:32:12,695 --> 01:32:14,095
How much will it cost?

1346
01:32:14,129 --> 01:32:15,529
It's not a
matter of money.

1347
01:32:15,564 --> 01:32:16,574
You must focus

1348
01:32:16,599 --> 01:32:18,129
on reconnecting
with arie's sources.

1349
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:19,596
Now, come on.
Decide.

1350
01:32:19,635 --> 01:32:21,635
You know the Aryan culture.
You were raised--

1351
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:22,970
you look more Aryan

1352
01:32:23,005 --> 01:32:24,805
and I know too many
people there.

1353
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,240
I'm sure to be
recognized.

1354
01:32:26,274 --> 01:32:27,344
You know the language.

1355
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:28,575
My language
is obviously foreign.

1356
01:32:28,611 --> 01:32:30,411
What if someone asks
where I'm from?

1357
01:32:30,445 --> 01:32:31,675
What if somebody
denounces me?

1358
01:32:31,714 --> 01:32:33,684
Flip a coin to decide?!

1359
01:32:33,716 --> 01:32:35,846
Come on, Yitzhak.

1360
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:39,254
You go and you bring us back
the weapons that we need.

1361
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:46,490
Look at this.

1362
01:32:46,528 --> 01:32:47,628
You look fine.

1363
01:32:47,663 --> 01:32:49,333
You look like
a Polish businessman.

1364
01:32:49,364 --> 01:32:50,734
Here.
If anybody asks you,

1365
01:32:50,766 --> 01:32:52,766
you came to town
to buy shirts. Ok?

1366
01:32:52,801 --> 01:32:54,801
The guards have been
greased.You're all set.

1367
01:32:54,837 --> 01:32:56,197
Look it--
look. This suit.

1368
01:32:56,238 --> 01:32:58,908
What do you want?
It's all we could find.

1369
01:32:58,941 --> 01:33:00,341
It's ridiculous!

1370
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:02,035
You look fine.

1371
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:03,407
Really.

1372
01:33:03,445 --> 01:33:05,345
Nice ankles.

1373
01:33:07,215 --> 01:33:11,115
Look. Ahem.
Your documents,

1374
01:33:11,153 --> 01:33:13,163
your new identity,

1375
01:33:13,188 --> 01:33:15,018
Vitok Metan.

1376
01:33:15,057 --> 01:33:16,257
Good luck, Marek.

1377
01:33:16,291 --> 01:33:17,161
Vitok.

1378
01:33:17,192 --> 01:33:19,562
Frania will escort
you to the other side.

1379
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:20,804
She'll bring you
to tosia,

1380
01:33:20,829 --> 01:33:22,429
who'll arrange
for you to contact

1381
01:33:22,464 --> 01:33:24,034
all the necessary
poles. Ok?

1382
01:33:24,066 --> 01:33:24,866
Where's frania?

1383
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:26,300
She's over there
with Julian.

1384
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:27,944
She's one of our
very best.

1385
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:28,770
Good.

1386
01:33:28,804 --> 01:33:30,314
I'll be watching
your back.

1387
01:33:30,338 --> 01:33:32,878
Oh, that makes me feel
much better.

1388
01:33:36,244 --> 01:33:37,714
Well...

1389
01:33:37,746 --> 01:33:39,876
I'm just
across the street.

1390
01:33:48,256 --> 01:33:49,886
Luck.

1391
01:34:23,458 --> 01:34:24,488
How is he?

1392
01:34:24,526 --> 01:34:27,196
He's not going to win
any beauty contests.

1393
01:34:30,298 --> 01:34:31,598
Welcome back.

1394
01:34:31,633 --> 01:34:33,103
You all right?

1395
01:34:33,135 --> 01:34:34,465
I've been better.

1396
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:35,502
Conserve
your strength, ok?

1397
01:34:35,537 --> 01:34:36,537
Just rest.

1398
01:34:36,571 --> 01:34:37,571
Mordechai--

1399
01:34:37,605 --> 01:34:40,935
you'll fight later.
Just get better.

1400
01:34:40,976 --> 01:34:42,436
Uh...

1401
01:34:42,477 --> 01:34:43,947
Arie, I need
to ask you.

1402
01:34:43,979 --> 01:34:46,679
I didn't tell them
anything.

1403
01:34:48,150 --> 01:34:49,680
Rest.

1404
01:34:53,488 --> 01:34:55,758
Kazik, how did you
get him out?

1405
01:34:55,791 --> 01:34:57,461
We did nothing.

1406
01:34:57,492 --> 01:34:59,262
The gestapo
made a mistake

1407
01:34:59,294 --> 01:35:02,064
and accepted
our bribe.

1408
01:35:02,097 --> 01:35:04,297
Even when I believe
you're telling the truth,

1409
01:35:04,332 --> 01:35:05,932
I think you're
making it up.

1410
01:35:05,968 --> 01:35:08,238
Now, there's a vote
of confidence for you.

1411
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,760
1929 lafite Rothschild.

1412
01:35:35,798 --> 01:35:40,738
Flawless. A bouquet
that will last a century.

1413
01:35:40,769 --> 01:35:43,709
Have yourself serve a sip,
Dr. Fritz hippler.

1414
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:45,908
You won't regret it.

1415
01:35:53,315 --> 01:35:55,275
Do I lie?

1416
01:35:55,317 --> 01:35:58,247
Is it not flawless?

1417
01:35:59,221 --> 01:36:02,191
Yes, it's very good.

1418
01:36:02,224 --> 01:36:04,234
Good?

1419
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:06,389
It's not good.

1420
01:36:07,562 --> 01:36:09,532
This is exquisite.

1421
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:15,236
I liked your movie,
the eternal Jew.

1422
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:16,770
It was relentless.

1423
01:36:16,805 --> 01:36:21,905
As the French would say,
apitoyer, without pity.

1424
01:36:21,944 --> 01:36:24,414
The eternal Jew.

1425
01:36:24,446 --> 01:36:26,476
What a terrifying title.

1426
01:36:26,514 --> 01:36:28,384
Hmm.

1427
01:36:29,417 --> 01:36:31,017
Big nose.

1428
01:36:31,053 --> 01:36:31,923
Fruity.

1429
01:36:31,954 --> 01:36:34,294
What do you think?

1430
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:38,955
I agree.

1431
01:36:38,994 --> 01:36:41,664
You are not a wine
aficionado, are you?

1432
01:36:41,696 --> 01:36:43,866
No. Not really.

1433
01:36:43,899 --> 01:36:45,699
It's a Jewish wine,

1434
01:36:45,733 --> 01:36:48,073
made by Jews,
Willen Gott.

1435
01:36:48,103 --> 01:36:49,403
Rothschild.

1436
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:54,440
Surprising, isn't it?

1437
01:36:54,476 --> 01:36:55,636
Hmm?

1438
01:36:55,677 --> 01:36:57,807
Enough about wine.

1439
01:37:01,383 --> 01:37:03,853
In confidence...

1440
01:37:03,886 --> 01:37:07,256
You've spent time around
colonel Von Sammern.

1441
01:37:07,289 --> 01:37:08,389
Haven't you?

1442
01:37:08,423 --> 01:37:09,423
Ja.

1443
01:37:09,457 --> 01:37:11,427
Tell me about him.

1444
01:37:14,629 --> 01:37:15,959
Where should I start?

1445
01:37:15,998 --> 01:37:17,828
With the engagement
on January 18,

1446
01:37:17,866 --> 01:37:19,826
when his troops were
first fired upon

1447
01:37:19,868 --> 01:37:22,298
by the sub-humans
of the Jewish sector.

1448
01:37:46,361 --> 01:37:49,401
German soldiers are massing
outside the ghetto

1449
01:37:49,431 --> 01:37:51,401
by the hundreds.

1450
01:37:51,433 --> 01:37:52,773
Caliber?

1451
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,240
9-mm.

1452
01:37:54,269 --> 01:37:55,499
Ahh...

1453
01:37:55,537 --> 01:37:57,007
One German,

1454
01:37:57,039 --> 01:37:59,209
2 Germans,
3 Germans.

1455
01:37:59,241 --> 01:38:01,041
Tuvia,
caliber?

1456
01:38:01,076 --> 01:38:02,946
7.62.

1457
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:16,689
7.92, carbine.

1458
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:19,634
Julian, how did you
get the rifle?

1459
01:38:19,661 --> 01:38:21,961
My eyesight.

1460
01:38:22,564 --> 01:38:24,174
Julian.

1461
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,570
I don't miss.

1462
01:38:27,602 --> 01:38:30,012
One German platoon.

1463
01:38:30,405 --> 01:38:32,465
Zygmunt.

1464
01:38:32,507 --> 01:38:33,607
7.92.

1465
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:00,773
Everyone's in place.

1466
01:39:00,802 --> 01:39:02,902
Do you hear this?
They're singing.

1467
01:39:02,937 --> 01:39:05,607
The bastards
are singing.

1468
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:01,133
Go. Go down.

1469
01:40:01,163 --> 01:40:03,603
Isaac, Sarah, move.

1470
01:40:31,693 --> 01:40:33,203
Auschwitz!

1471
01:40:36,931 --> 01:40:38,531
Treblinka!

1472
01:41:01,623 --> 01:41:03,693
Dachau!

1473
01:41:15,203 --> 01:41:16,643
Good shot, Julian!

1474
01:41:16,671 --> 01:41:19,141
Treblinka!

1475
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:31,290
Bring down
Dr. hippler here.

1476
01:41:32,587 --> 01:41:33,387
Hit the tank!

1477
01:41:33,421 --> 01:41:35,661
Hit the tank
while the hatch is open!

1478
01:41:38,226 --> 01:41:40,156
Why are you filming?

1479
01:41:40,195 --> 01:41:42,055
I was assigned
by Herr Goebbels

1480
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:43,626
to film this operation.

1481
01:41:46,968 --> 01:41:49,068
He says the film
of these engagements

1482
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:50,313
will outlast us all.

1483
01:41:50,338 --> 01:41:52,868
Victory will outlast us all.
This is not victory.

1484
01:41:52,907 --> 01:41:55,577
All depends on where
you put the camera.

1485
01:42:25,072 --> 01:42:27,072
Did he think he could
waltz his army

1486
01:42:27,108 --> 01:42:28,238
into the sector,

1487
01:42:28,276 --> 01:42:30,646
like sightseers
on holiday?

1488
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:33,449
All is lost.

1489
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:36,051
The troops have retreated.
Many are dead or wounded.

1490
01:42:36,083 --> 01:42:37,223
I know.

1491
01:42:37,252 --> 01:42:38,552
I was there.

1492
01:42:38,586 --> 01:42:39,386
We must respond

1493
01:42:39,421 --> 01:42:41,121
with overwhelming force
immediately.

1494
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:43,115
From the reichsfuhrer.

1495
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:44,357
Reichsfuhrer Himmler

1496
01:42:44,392 --> 01:42:46,832
promised Hitler
a Warsaw free of Jews

1497
01:42:46,861 --> 01:42:48,131
by his birthday
tomorrow.

1498
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:49,302
You understand this?

1499
01:42:49,331 --> 01:42:51,371
If other Jews are
emboldened by this...

1500
01:42:51,399 --> 01:42:53,339
Turn of events,
other sectors

1501
01:42:53,368 --> 01:42:55,038
initiate their
own uprisings,

1502
01:42:55,069 --> 01:42:56,539
it spreads to the poles.

1503
01:42:56,571 --> 01:42:58,971
You see
the implications?

1504
01:42:59,006 --> 01:43:01,036
See the cause
for concern?

1505
01:43:01,075 --> 01:43:03,345
Under orders
of the high command,

1506
01:43:03,378 --> 01:43:07,418
you are relieved
of your post forthwith.

1507
01:43:07,449 --> 01:43:08,949
Oh.

1508
01:43:08,983 --> 01:43:12,223
And to avoid
any unnecessary strain

1509
01:43:12,254 --> 01:43:14,024
between
German-Austrian factions

1510
01:43:14,055 --> 01:43:15,755
in the SS ranks...

1511
01:43:16,858 --> 01:43:18,088
The order
for your execution

1512
01:43:18,125 --> 01:43:20,225
has been withdrawn.

1513
01:43:20,262 --> 01:43:22,202
You're dismissed.

1514
01:43:27,269 --> 01:43:29,499
We're still here.
Who would have bet on it?

1515
01:43:29,537 --> 01:43:32,337
We have some real weapons
to fight back with.

1516
01:43:43,017 --> 01:43:45,487
Julian, well done.

1517
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:50,686
Look.

1518
01:43:53,628 --> 01:43:55,898
Our little nation.

1519
01:43:57,299 --> 01:43:59,269
Did you ever think
in your lifetime

1520
01:43:59,301 --> 01:44:00,941
you would see this?

1521
01:44:43,177 --> 01:44:44,507
What is he doing?

1522
01:44:44,546 --> 01:44:46,946
Either he's showing his troops
that he's not afraid,

1523
01:44:46,981 --> 01:44:49,021
or he really
likes his table.

1524
01:45:00,362 --> 01:45:03,062
Give those out
to the officers.

1525
01:45:03,097 --> 01:45:04,727
Good for their nerves.

1526
01:45:10,338 --> 01:45:13,478
How can you sleep
at a time like this?

1527
01:45:14,308 --> 01:45:16,608
Easily.

1528
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:26,892
Dr. hippler.

1529
01:45:29,591 --> 01:45:30,531
Yes, sir.

1530
01:45:30,558 --> 01:45:33,128
I don't care
where you put the camera,

1531
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:35,460
just don't film the flags.

1532
01:45:35,497 --> 01:45:39,027
But it makes
for a better story.

1533
01:45:39,066 --> 01:45:40,666
They show what
our soldiers

1534
01:45:40,702 --> 01:45:43,372
had to overcome in order
to achieve victory.

1535
01:45:43,405 --> 01:45:44,705
And general Kruger
was quite--

1536
01:45:44,739 --> 01:45:47,139
you are not
to shoot the flags.

1537
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:49,314
Unless general Kruger
shows up personally

1538
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:51,083
and instructs you to do so.

1539
01:45:51,112 --> 01:45:52,752
Is that clear?

1540
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:54,020
Crystal clear.

1541
01:46:06,794 --> 01:46:08,564
I should wake Marek.

1542
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:14,596
Marek, wake up!

1543
01:46:14,636 --> 01:46:16,436
Wait.

1544
01:46:42,997 --> 01:46:44,527
Now?

1545
01:46:45,633 --> 01:46:47,173
Not yet.

1546
01:46:52,974 --> 01:46:54,684
Now.

1547
01:46:58,212 --> 01:46:59,782
6 more.

1548
01:47:05,853 --> 01:47:06,993
Now.

1549
01:47:57,304 --> 01:47:59,074
Dozens of our men
were killed,

1550
01:47:59,106 --> 01:48:00,336
more wounded,

1551
01:48:00,374 --> 01:48:01,984
at the brushmaker's.

1552
01:49:08,409 --> 01:49:10,309
Pull the tank out!

1553
01:49:10,344 --> 01:49:12,784
Pull the tank out!

1554
01:49:15,349 --> 01:49:16,779
Further.

1555
01:49:24,191 --> 01:49:27,061
No. Further.

1556
01:49:32,667 --> 01:49:34,597
Hold! Hold your positions!

1557
01:49:34,636 --> 01:49:36,066
Hold your positions!

1558
01:49:38,305 --> 01:49:40,065
Stand clear!
It's in the air!

1559
01:49:40,107 --> 01:49:41,977
Hold your positions!

1560
01:49:45,579 --> 01:49:47,719
Quickly!

1561
01:49:54,388 --> 01:49:55,818
Far enough?

1562
01:50:14,275 --> 01:50:16,575
Dear Yitzhak,

1563
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:18,210
I don't know
what to write you.

1564
01:50:18,245 --> 01:50:21,145
Let's dispense with
the personal details this time.

1565
01:50:21,182 --> 01:50:23,382
I've only one expression
to describe my feelings

1566
01:50:23,417 --> 01:50:25,017
and the feelings
of my comrades.

1567
01:50:25,052 --> 01:50:27,892
Things have surpassed
our boldest dreams."

1568
01:50:27,922 --> 01:50:29,322
"The Germans ran away

1569
01:50:29,356 --> 01:50:30,656
"from the ghetto twice.

1570
01:50:30,692 --> 01:50:31,762
"One of our units

1571
01:50:31,793 --> 01:50:33,233
"held out for 14 minutes

1572
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:35,760
"and the other one
for more than 6 hours.

1573
01:50:35,797 --> 01:50:38,827
"Know that the pistol
has no value.

1574
01:50:38,866 --> 01:50:40,936
Practically
don't use it."

1575
01:50:41,969 --> 01:50:44,639
"We need grenades,
rifles, machine guns,

1576
01:50:44,672 --> 01:50:47,042
"and explosives.

1577
01:50:47,074 --> 01:50:49,244
Your friend in arms,
Mordechai."

1578
01:50:51,612 --> 01:50:54,822
Yes, I did say that,
reichsfuhrer Himmler.

1579
01:50:54,849 --> 01:50:56,649
They are crafty,
but we will put

1580
01:50:56,684 --> 01:50:59,624
an immediate end
to this uprising.

1581
01:50:59,653 --> 01:51:00,693
No, not today.

1582
01:51:00,722 --> 01:51:03,022
2, 3 days, perhaps.

1583
01:51:03,057 --> 01:51:04,427
Excuse me.

1584
01:51:05,793 --> 01:51:07,293
Yes, of course.

1585
01:51:11,665 --> 01:51:13,665
Yes, reichs--uh...

1586
01:51:17,338 --> 01:51:19,268
Feuer!

1587
01:51:23,544 --> 01:51:24,984
Aaahhh!

1588
01:51:30,651 --> 01:51:32,251
Now it is serious.

1589
01:51:34,722 --> 01:51:36,522
Go. Get down
in the basement now!

1590
01:51:36,557 --> 01:51:37,657
Come here!

1591
01:51:37,691 --> 01:51:39,491
Bring everyone in
from the roof!

1592
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:40,756
Get Calel in!

1593
01:51:48,369 --> 01:51:49,769
Mira! Get Calel!

1594
01:51:49,804 --> 01:51:52,514
Pull back!
Bring everybody in!

1595
01:51:52,539 --> 01:51:54,109
Pull back!

1596
01:51:58,379 --> 01:51:59,479
Feuer!

1597
01:52:02,116 --> 01:52:03,316
Get out of here!

1598
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:12,958
Go through there!

1599
01:52:12,994 --> 01:52:15,734
Hurry! To the right!
To the right!

1600
01:52:36,450 --> 01:52:38,090
Zachariah.

1601
01:52:38,853 --> 01:52:39,853
Where is Gisl?

1602
01:52:39,887 --> 01:52:41,117
The vineyards.

1603
01:52:42,223 --> 01:52:43,263
Ohh!

1604
01:52:43,290 --> 01:52:44,390
Ohh...

1605
01:52:44,425 --> 01:52:46,085
Theo! Mikael!

1606
01:52:46,127 --> 01:52:48,527
They're to be sent
to the fighters right away.

1607
01:52:48,562 --> 01:52:49,932
Right away.

1608
01:52:54,802 --> 01:52:57,872
I have corrected
your mistake.

1609
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:00,910
There were
no casualties today.

1610
01:53:00,942 --> 01:53:02,242
There are
no mistakes.

1611
01:53:02,276 --> 01:53:03,076
There were--

1612
01:53:03,110 --> 01:53:05,080
there are
no mistakes now!

1613
01:53:05,112 --> 01:53:07,882
Have you apprehended
the leaders yet?

1614
01:53:07,915 --> 01:53:09,745
Not yet, sir. I've--

1615
01:53:09,783 --> 01:53:11,323
I'm not looking
for an explanation!

1616
01:53:11,352 --> 01:53:13,322
I'm looking for
an acceptable answer.

1617
01:53:13,354 --> 01:53:14,394
And that would be,
"yes,

1618
01:53:14,421 --> 01:53:16,721
we have captured and
destroyed the leadership."

1619
01:53:21,428 --> 01:53:22,498
Heil, Hitler.

1620
01:53:22,529 --> 01:53:24,929
I have a message
from Himmler.

1621
01:53:24,966 --> 01:53:28,196
I have just begun to get us out
of this disgraceful situation.

1622
01:53:28,235 --> 01:53:29,495
Do you wish to hear

1623
01:53:29,536 --> 01:53:31,236
what the reichsfuhrer
has to say?

1624
01:53:33,374 --> 01:53:34,944
Of course.

1625
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,936
As a lover of Wagner,

1626
01:53:36,978 --> 01:53:38,248
he said
that you conducted

1627
01:53:38,279 --> 01:53:41,779
the overture to this grand
operation magnificently,

1628
01:53:41,815 --> 01:53:44,785
particularly compared
to Von Sammern.

1629
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:46,288
He went on to say,

1630
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,990
"play on, maestro.

1631
01:53:49,023 --> 01:53:51,893
The fuhrer and I
won't forget you."

1632
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:55,960
We in London
now have in our possession

1633
01:53:55,997 --> 01:53:58,227
concrete information concerning
the systematic mass murder

1634
01:53:58,265 --> 01:54:00,595
of the Jewish population
in Poland

1635
01:54:00,634 --> 01:54:02,404
committed by
the German nation.

1636
01:54:02,436 --> 01:54:04,606
The Polish courier must
have gotten through.

1637
01:54:04,638 --> 01:54:05,838
There is no other way

1638
01:54:05,873 --> 01:54:07,913
they could've gotten
those details so right.

1639
01:54:07,942 --> 01:54:09,912
If the allies would
bomb the railroads

1640
01:54:09,944 --> 01:54:11,884
or the camps
or even Warsaw itself,

1641
01:54:11,913 --> 01:54:13,113
we will have a chance.

1642
01:54:13,147 --> 01:54:15,147
I don't know.
Do you really think?

1643
01:54:15,182 --> 01:54:16,182
Sure.

1644
01:54:16,217 --> 01:54:17,377
The scum Calel.

1645
01:54:17,418 --> 01:54:18,718
Jewish
police scum!

1646
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:20,222
What is he
doing here?!

1647
01:54:20,254 --> 01:54:21,364
Leave him!

1648
01:54:23,024 --> 01:54:24,834
No, no, no!
Get off of me!

1649
01:54:24,858 --> 01:54:26,658
I'll kill you
with my own hands!

1650
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:28,503
He's one of us!
Get off!

1651
01:54:28,529 --> 01:54:29,929
Get him
out of here!

1652
01:54:29,964 --> 01:54:31,234
He killed
my father!

1653
01:54:34,668 --> 01:54:36,338
They're right...

1654
01:54:36,370 --> 01:54:37,400
What they said.

1655
01:54:37,438 --> 01:54:38,538
I did.

1656
01:54:38,572 --> 01:54:40,642
I know, and
you know I know.

1657
01:54:40,674 --> 01:54:42,814
But we don't have--
listen to me.

1658
01:54:42,843 --> 01:54:45,053
We don't have time
to dwell on the past.

1659
01:54:45,079 --> 01:54:48,649
There's only time to plan
for our immediate future.

1660
01:54:48,682 --> 01:54:49,982
Mordechai.

1661
01:54:52,019 --> 01:54:54,889
The weapons didn't
make it through.

1662
01:55:03,497 --> 01:55:04,497
Yitzhak?

1663
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,940
Our shipment of weapons was
intercepted by the Germans

1664
01:55:08,970 --> 01:55:10,200
in the cemetery.

1665
01:55:10,237 --> 01:55:12,467
And the Germans
discovered the tunnel

1666
01:55:12,506 --> 01:55:13,976
at Muranowsky.

1667
01:55:14,008 --> 01:55:15,608
It was
no longer safe.

1668
01:55:15,642 --> 01:55:18,012
Today is Easter,
right?

1669
01:55:18,045 --> 01:55:20,605
Tosia, you're going
out for some fresh air.

1670
01:55:20,647 --> 01:55:22,017
You must take
these explosives

1671
01:55:22,049 --> 01:55:24,049
and get them to Mordechai
no matter what.

1672
01:55:24,085 --> 01:55:25,885
You must get them
to the fighters.

1673
01:55:25,919 --> 01:55:27,249
Do you hear?

1674
01:55:46,107 --> 01:55:48,277
Get back, everybody!
Get back!

1675
01:55:52,546 --> 01:55:54,316
Back.

1676
01:56:25,546 --> 01:56:27,406
Out
for a Sunday stroll...

1677
01:56:27,448 --> 01:56:28,478
Jew bitch?

1678
01:56:28,515 --> 01:56:31,015
We're now going to follow
you around all day.

1679
01:56:31,052 --> 01:56:32,452
3,000 zlotys,

1680
01:56:32,486 --> 01:56:34,586
or we introduce you
to the gestapo.

1681
01:56:36,690 --> 01:56:39,360
Ha ha! Ha! Ok!

1682
01:56:39,393 --> 01:56:40,693
Let's go.

1683
01:56:40,727 --> 01:56:43,757
No, come. Let's go. I want
to see the little room.

1684
01:56:44,731 --> 01:56:45,901
What little room?

1685
01:56:45,932 --> 01:56:48,202
The little room
the gestapo reserves

1686
01:56:48,235 --> 01:56:50,135
for really, really
pathetic crooks

1687
01:56:50,171 --> 01:56:52,471
who waste their time
turning in fellow poles.

1688
01:56:53,374 --> 01:56:55,884
Yes, I understand
that those thugs

1689
01:56:55,909 --> 01:56:58,049
are given
the full treatment.

1690
01:56:58,079 --> 01:57:00,179
So, let's go.

1691
01:57:05,786 --> 01:57:06,816
The door!

1692
01:57:06,853 --> 01:57:08,993
I will create a diversion!

1693
01:57:09,022 --> 01:57:13,862
* Dominus vobiscum *

1694
01:57:13,894 --> 01:57:17,934
* et cum spiritu tuum *

1695
01:57:47,728 --> 01:57:49,758
Strip the women naked!

1696
01:57:49,796 --> 01:57:51,026
This won't happen again.

1697
01:58:02,443 --> 01:58:03,613
Get the ladder.

1698
01:58:14,321 --> 01:58:16,021
Now, that's
a fine marksman.

1699
01:58:16,056 --> 01:58:17,656
They call them
parachutists

1700
01:58:17,691 --> 01:58:19,291
or balloonists.

1701
01:58:19,326 --> 01:58:20,886
They've devised
a game

1702
01:58:20,927 --> 01:58:22,727
whereby the winner
is he who delivers

1703
01:58:22,763 --> 01:58:24,173
the most bullets
to the jumper

1704
01:58:24,198 --> 01:58:25,668
before he hits
the ground.

1705
01:58:26,667 --> 01:58:28,997
Films and photographs
of this kind of operation

1706
01:58:29,035 --> 01:58:31,405
will be invaluable
to future historians

1707
01:58:31,438 --> 01:58:34,208
of the third Reich.
They'll also be useful

1708
01:58:34,241 --> 01:58:36,411
as training materials
for the SS...

1709
01:58:37,444 --> 01:58:40,414
And as living document
of the sacrifices

1710
01:58:40,447 --> 01:58:42,277
that the Nordic
races made

1711
01:58:42,316 --> 01:58:44,786
to rid Europe and
the world of the Jews.

1712
01:58:46,787 --> 01:58:49,357
All the exits
are blocked.

1713
01:58:49,390 --> 01:58:51,990
Well, we can't stay here.
We have to leave now.

1714
01:58:52,025 --> 01:58:53,825
How? If there's
no way out,

1715
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:55,160
we'll be
easy targets.

1716
01:58:55,196 --> 01:58:56,826
I'll go out first.

1717
01:58:56,863 --> 01:58:58,303
I'll get
their attention.

1718
01:58:58,332 --> 01:59:00,402
What are you
talking about?

1719
01:59:02,836 --> 01:59:04,336
You once asked me,

1720
01:59:04,371 --> 01:59:06,911
"can a moral man
maintain his moral code

1721
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:08,910
in an immoral world?"

1722
01:59:10,544 --> 01:59:11,984
Here's my answer.

1723
02:00:17,678 --> 02:00:20,008
Aah!

1724
02:00:29,290 --> 02:00:31,390
Aah!

1725
02:00:32,192 --> 02:00:33,792
Rot in hell,

1726
02:00:33,827 --> 02:00:35,697
you bastards!

1727
02:00:38,699 --> 02:00:40,429
Corpus Christi...

1728
02:01:04,825 --> 02:01:06,825
Aaahhh!

1729
02:01:24,277 --> 02:01:26,477
Paradise lost.

1730
02:01:27,681 --> 02:01:29,281
Follow me.

1731
02:01:30,216 --> 02:01:32,586
Julian, guard the rear.

1732
02:01:36,022 --> 02:01:37,692
All right. All right.
It's kazik.

1733
02:01:37,724 --> 02:01:39,194
Quick.

1734
02:01:39,225 --> 02:01:41,285
Follow me.
Deworah. Zachariah.

1735
02:01:43,296 --> 02:01:44,566
This way.

1736
02:02:33,714 --> 02:02:36,354
The relativity Jew,
Albert Einstein,

1737
02:02:36,383 --> 02:02:38,153
masked his hatred
of Germans

1738
02:02:38,184 --> 02:02:40,724
behind his obscure
pseudo-sciences.

1739
02:02:40,754 --> 02:02:44,024
The art of propaganda
is not well understood,

1740
02:02:44,057 --> 02:02:45,727
is it?

1741
02:02:45,759 --> 02:02:48,529
Keep it simple,
repeat it over and over

1742
02:02:48,562 --> 02:02:51,002
until it takes on
a life of its own.

1743
02:02:51,031 --> 02:02:54,071
Becomes the truth,
in effect.

1744
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:55,700
We are not
the only one, sir,

1745
02:02:55,736 --> 02:02:58,196
fighting the war
on the film front.

1746
02:02:58,238 --> 02:03:00,268
The allies have hired
frank Capra

1747
02:03:00,306 --> 02:03:01,576
to direct their efforts.

1748
02:03:01,608 --> 02:03:04,238
Should I know
that name?

1749
02:03:04,277 --> 02:03:07,047
He's a very successful
Hollywood filmmaker.

1750
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:07,980
A little sappy

1751
02:03:08,014 --> 02:03:12,154
for my taste, but...
At the top of his game.

1752
02:03:12,185 --> 02:03:14,145
Seems the Americans
weren't all that

1753
02:03:14,187 --> 02:03:16,087
interested
in going to war,

1754
02:03:16,122 --> 02:03:18,222
so he was
brought in to...

1755
02:03:18,258 --> 02:03:20,258
Popularize
the notion.

1756
02:03:20,293 --> 02:03:22,263
Worse still,
he stole footage

1757
02:03:22,295 --> 02:03:25,825
that I commissioned
and used it for ridicule.

1758
02:03:25,866 --> 02:03:27,326
As I say...

1759
02:03:27,367 --> 02:03:29,737
It all depends on
where you put the camera

1760
02:03:29,770 --> 02:03:32,770
and who is telling
the story.

1761
02:03:36,342 --> 02:03:37,942
These are not
the Aryan women

1762
02:03:37,978 --> 02:03:40,208
from my hometown
Detmold.

1763
02:03:40,246 --> 02:03:42,616
They are acrobatic
sharpshooters,

1764
02:03:42,649 --> 02:03:45,749
fighting demons.
Amazons.

1765
02:03:48,689 --> 02:03:52,159
I don't believe this business
about Jewish women

1766
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:54,562
bewitching Aryans.

1767
02:03:54,595 --> 02:03:57,925
She is expressive,
though.

1768
02:04:11,211 --> 02:04:13,611
Careful with the basket.

1769
02:04:13,647 --> 02:04:15,677
Up, up. Are you sure
you're all right?

1770
02:04:15,716 --> 02:04:18,276
Have you hurt
yourself?

1771
02:04:18,318 --> 02:04:19,848
What have you
brought us?

1772
02:04:19,886 --> 02:04:20,886
Ahh. Dynamite.

1773
02:04:20,921 --> 02:04:21,961
Ahh. Excellent.

1774
02:04:24,725 --> 02:04:26,685
Commander Zuckerman,
you understand

1775
02:04:26,727 --> 02:04:28,957
that the considerations
we face today

1776
02:04:28,995 --> 02:04:31,125
are extremely complex.

1777
02:04:31,164 --> 02:04:32,574
Of course.

1778
02:04:32,599 --> 02:04:35,169
There are those
in the home army,

1779
02:04:35,201 --> 02:04:36,971
those here
and in London

1780
02:04:37,003 --> 02:04:40,513
that feel the transfer
of weapons to...

1781
02:04:40,541 --> 02:04:43,081
Untrained Jewish
street fighters

1782
02:04:43,109 --> 02:04:45,649
is a futile
and wasteful use

1783
02:04:45,679 --> 02:04:47,509
of our limited resources.

1784
02:04:47,548 --> 02:04:51,178
And what if this Jewish
uprising were to spread?

1785
02:04:51,217 --> 02:04:52,487
The Polish underground

1786
02:04:52,519 --> 02:04:54,889
is hardly equipped
to take on German forces.

1787
02:04:54,921 --> 02:04:57,261
Thousands of poles
would be slaughtered,

1788
02:04:57,290 --> 02:04:59,390
and we cannot
allow that to happen.

1789
02:04:59,425 --> 02:05:00,625
May I remind you,
colonel,

1790
02:05:00,661 --> 02:05:02,401
that we, too,
are Polish citizens.

1791
02:05:02,428 --> 02:05:04,798
Perhaps these influences
in the home army

1792
02:05:04,831 --> 02:05:07,171
are secretly grateful
to the Nazis

1793
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:08,970
for ridding
their country of Jews.

1794
02:05:09,002 --> 02:05:12,712
I pray to god
you can rise above
those influences.

1795
02:05:12,739 --> 02:05:15,539
The considerations
we face are complex.

1796
02:05:15,576 --> 02:05:17,376
That may be.
But you see, colonel,

1797
02:05:17,410 --> 02:05:19,080
the considerations
my people face

1798
02:05:19,112 --> 02:05:20,582
are simple.

1799
02:05:20,614 --> 02:05:22,424
In fact,
I would have to say

1800
02:05:22,448 --> 02:05:24,278
that the considerations
my people face

1801
02:05:24,317 --> 02:05:28,017
are positively
elemental.

1802
02:05:28,054 --> 02:05:30,364
We must have arms.

1803
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:32,760
We must have
explosives.

1804
02:05:32,793 --> 02:05:36,163
We must have something
other than our fists

1805
02:05:36,196 --> 02:05:38,226
and--and bricks

1806
02:05:38,264 --> 02:05:41,204
and our unbreakable
will.

1807
02:05:41,234 --> 02:05:43,544
Immediately!

1808
02:05:43,570 --> 02:05:46,440
You take no risk!

1809
02:05:46,472 --> 02:05:49,282
And if you fail to act,

1810
02:05:49,309 --> 02:05:52,149
our blood
will be on your hands.

1811
02:06:08,895 --> 02:06:10,925
Mommy!

1812
02:06:12,465 --> 02:06:14,935
Mommy!

1813
02:06:14,968 --> 02:06:16,538
Mommy!

1814
02:06:16,569 --> 02:06:18,139
Shh, shh, shh!

1815
02:06:18,171 --> 02:06:20,471
Mommy!

1816
02:06:20,506 --> 02:06:23,336
Mommy!

1817
02:06:23,376 --> 02:06:26,106
Mommy!

1818
02:06:26,146 --> 02:06:27,846
No!

1819
02:06:27,881 --> 02:06:29,921
Mommy!

1820
02:06:29,950 --> 02:06:31,180
Mommy!

1821
02:06:34,855 --> 02:06:36,585
Mommy!

1822
02:06:37,523 --> 02:06:39,963
Mommy!

1823
02:06:41,962 --> 02:06:43,302
Mommy!

1824
02:06:45,298 --> 02:06:47,368
Mommy!

1825
02:06:51,604 --> 02:06:53,814
Hands up!

1826
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:55,780
Mommy!

1827
02:06:55,809 --> 02:06:57,539
Mommy!

1828
02:06:57,577 --> 02:06:59,707
Hands up!

1829
02:06:59,746 --> 02:07:01,746
Check the holes!

1830
02:07:03,583 --> 02:07:06,423
Take your clothes
off!

1831
02:07:06,452 --> 02:07:08,022
Right now! Hands up!

1832
02:07:36,349 --> 02:07:38,789
Your plan sounds
reasonable...

1833
02:07:38,819 --> 02:07:40,719
And your reports
to Himmler

1834
02:07:40,754 --> 02:07:44,494
make it seem as if
things were going well.

1835
02:07:44,524 --> 02:07:46,534
But they aren't,
now, are they?

1836
02:07:46,559 --> 02:07:48,329
General Kruger...

1837
02:07:48,361 --> 02:07:51,501
In a very short while,
the Jewish sector of Warsaw

1838
02:07:51,531 --> 02:07:52,971
will be no more.

1839
02:07:52,999 --> 02:07:55,599
Every building will be
razed to the ground.

1840
02:07:55,635 --> 02:07:57,635
Then we will
bring these vermin

1841
02:07:57,670 --> 02:07:59,740
to the surface
or bury them.

1842
02:07:59,773 --> 02:08:02,313
In a short while?

1843
02:08:02,342 --> 02:08:03,682
This little group
of bandits

1844
02:08:03,710 --> 02:08:05,110
have held off
the German military

1845
02:08:05,145 --> 02:08:08,405
for longer than
the entire country of Poland.

1846
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:11,118
Is that a short while?

1847
02:08:12,719 --> 02:08:15,489
It would make
your job and mine easier

1848
02:08:15,521 --> 02:08:19,961
if your reports
weren't so...Optimistic...

1849
02:08:19,993 --> 02:08:21,933
And our casualties
were...

1850
02:08:21,962 --> 02:08:23,862
Grab the guns
and the ammo!

1851
02:08:23,897 --> 02:08:26,597
Shall we say, less,

1852
02:08:26,632 --> 02:08:29,202
to be perfectly blunt.

1853
02:08:36,509 --> 02:08:38,279
Jan.

1854
02:08:42,482 --> 02:08:44,682
No luck.

1855
02:08:44,717 --> 02:08:46,947
The poles won't give
us any more weapons.

1856
02:08:46,987 --> 02:08:48,187
And you?

1857
02:08:48,221 --> 02:08:49,361
None.

1858
02:08:53,726 --> 02:08:55,426
Any word from tosia?

1859
02:08:59,432 --> 02:09:01,402
The others are secure.
Follow me.

1860
02:09:01,434 --> 02:09:02,544
Where?

1861
02:09:02,568 --> 02:09:04,238
There's a bunker
at Mila 18.

1862
02:09:25,591 --> 02:09:27,461
These are your
fighters, kazik?

1863
02:09:27,493 --> 02:09:28,493
Yes.

1864
02:09:28,528 --> 02:09:29,998
Ok, go.

1865
02:10:12,605 --> 02:10:15,275
Schmuel Asher,
Mordechai Anielewicz.

1866
02:10:15,308 --> 02:10:16,308
Hello.

1867
02:10:16,342 --> 02:10:17,612
Hi.

1868
02:10:17,643 --> 02:10:20,383
I've heard about you
and your group.

1869
02:10:21,647 --> 02:10:22,947
Now...

1870
02:10:22,983 --> 02:10:26,623
Let me show you around
my basement empire.

1871
02:10:26,652 --> 02:10:27,692
Auschwitz,

1872
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:29,190
Treblinka,

1873
02:10:29,222 --> 02:10:31,162
Sobibor.

1874
02:10:34,394 --> 02:10:36,934
And there is Mauthausen.

1875
02:10:36,963 --> 02:10:39,803
We have running water.

1876
02:10:39,832 --> 02:10:42,272
We have electricity.

1877
02:10:43,503 --> 02:10:45,643
But it's too hot...

1878
02:10:45,671 --> 02:10:48,911
And the dust is horrible
for my allergies.

1879
02:10:51,144 --> 02:10:54,384
Come on. I'll show you
something, guys.

1880
02:10:54,414 --> 02:10:56,654
There are 5 entrances

1881
02:10:56,682 --> 02:10:58,682
and 5 exits.

1882
02:10:58,718 --> 02:11:01,388
They come in handy
in my line of work.

1883
02:11:01,421 --> 02:11:03,121
This way.

1884
02:11:06,359 --> 02:11:07,859
Who's winning?

1885
02:11:10,563 --> 02:11:13,973
Whatever is ours
is yours.

1886
02:11:15,235 --> 02:11:18,165
Well, um...
Not really everything.

1887
02:11:18,204 --> 02:11:19,274
Ha ha ha.

1888
02:11:44,397 --> 02:11:45,827
Sorry, I can't.

1889
02:11:45,865 --> 02:11:47,565
It's all right.

1890
02:11:50,303 --> 02:11:54,673
Tuvia was unable to make it
to the inside via the sewers.

1891
02:11:54,707 --> 02:11:55,877
I'll go.

1892
02:11:55,908 --> 02:11:57,908
No, you won't.
Not until your ankle heals.

1893
02:11:57,944 --> 02:12:01,554
Kazik, I want you to go,
and, uh...

1894
02:12:01,581 --> 02:12:03,481
Bring zygmunt with you.

1895
02:12:03,516 --> 02:12:05,216
Ha. Oh, that's perfect.

1896
02:12:05,251 --> 02:12:07,051
Tuvia couldn't
make the cross,

1897
02:12:07,087 --> 02:12:08,717
so we send kazik.

1898
02:12:08,754 --> 02:12:10,524
What makes you think
we can succeed?

1899
02:12:10,556 --> 02:12:12,756
Because you're going
to go through the tunnel.

1900
02:12:12,792 --> 02:12:13,892
What tunnel?

1901
02:12:13,926 --> 02:12:15,856
The tunnel
at Muranowska.

1902
02:12:15,895 --> 02:12:17,855
There's a tunnel there
for special occasions.

1903
02:12:17,897 --> 02:12:20,767
The question is...
How safe is it?

1904
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:23,900
Yes. Yes, that is
a good question.

1905
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:26,206
Yeah. It's risky,
but it's worth it.

1906
02:12:26,239 --> 02:12:28,209
If Yitzhak has found
guns and supplies,

1907
02:12:28,241 --> 02:12:30,441
we can hold off
for a while longer.

1908
02:12:30,476 --> 02:12:31,576
Even if he hasn't,

1909
02:12:31,611 --> 02:12:35,051
it's critical that we find
a way in and out of the ghetto.

1910
02:12:35,081 --> 02:12:37,721
We're playing cat and mouse
with stroop and his men.

1911
02:12:37,750 --> 02:12:39,450
We can't hold out forever.

1912
02:12:39,485 --> 02:12:42,655
Yesterday we were seeking
safe passage to Palestine.

1913
02:12:44,624 --> 02:12:47,464
Today we seek safe passage
across the street.

1914
02:12:48,861 --> 02:12:50,961
Our world has gotten
pretty small, eh?

1915
02:12:54,267 --> 02:12:56,197
Luck.

1916
02:12:56,702 --> 02:12:58,142
Luck.

1917
02:13:01,374 --> 02:13:03,484
Go. Make me proud.

1918
02:13:04,944 --> 02:13:07,314
Make yourself proud.

1919
02:13:18,891 --> 02:13:21,191
Let's go, Romeo.

1920
02:13:41,414 --> 02:13:43,984
I'm instructing
zivia and Marek

1921
02:13:44,016 --> 02:13:46,516
to assemble a small squad.

1922
02:13:46,552 --> 02:13:47,892
Their mission will be

1923
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:49,920
to find an exit
out of the ghetto

1924
02:13:49,955 --> 02:13:52,385
through the sewer canals.

1925
02:13:52,425 --> 02:13:54,385
This is going to be
very difficult,

1926
02:13:54,427 --> 02:13:57,027
if not impossible,
as we know.

1927
02:13:57,063 --> 02:14:01,273
The maze of canals
is vast and confusing.

1928
02:14:01,301 --> 02:14:04,971
Those who...
Wish to leave

1929
02:14:05,004 --> 02:14:06,844
will be given
the opportunity.

1930
02:14:06,872 --> 02:14:10,042
Those who wish to stay
will do so.

1931
02:14:10,076 --> 02:14:12,446
Perhaps it will be
possible to...

1932
02:14:12,478 --> 02:14:14,648
Connect with the partisans
in the forest

1933
02:14:14,680 --> 02:14:17,220
and to continue our fight.

1934
02:14:18,584 --> 02:14:20,994
Perhaps not.

1935
02:14:21,020 --> 02:14:24,320
But throughout
our difficult struggle,

1936
02:14:24,357 --> 02:14:28,787
we have been determined
to preserve one choice.

1937
02:14:31,631 --> 02:14:33,601
How we die.

1938
02:14:35,135 --> 02:14:38,595
Whether it be here,
in an airless bunker,

1939
02:14:38,638 --> 02:14:40,608
or elsewhere,

1940
02:14:40,640 --> 02:14:42,780
I don't know.

1941
02:14:42,808 --> 02:14:45,248
But I can assure you
of one thing.

1942
02:14:48,114 --> 02:14:50,484
The spirit of our deaths...

1943
02:14:53,119 --> 02:14:54,619
Ahem.

1944
02:14:54,654 --> 02:14:56,324
The spirit of our deaths

1945
02:14:56,356 --> 02:14:59,786
will shape the soul
of a new generation.

1946
02:15:01,294 --> 02:15:04,304
A new nation of Jews.

1947
02:15:06,132 --> 02:15:08,072
All right.

1948
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:10,540
Let's wish zivia
and Marek luck.

1949
02:15:10,570 --> 02:15:12,770
Luck!

1950
02:15:12,805 --> 02:15:14,765
And we continue.

1951
02:15:21,981 --> 02:15:23,981
You're a sight
for sore eyes.

1952
02:15:24,016 --> 02:15:26,346
So are you.

1953
02:15:28,754 --> 02:15:30,964
And...

1954
02:15:30,990 --> 02:15:32,690
Julian?

1955
02:15:35,695 --> 02:15:37,595
He's our best
marksman.

1956
02:15:37,630 --> 02:15:39,970
Oh...

1957
02:15:41,767 --> 02:15:43,167
No, no, kazik,
it's all right!

1958
02:15:43,203 --> 02:15:44,573
It's all right!

1959
02:15:52,712 --> 02:15:54,882
Tell me.

1960
02:15:54,914 --> 02:15:57,624
Something is not right.

1961
02:15:57,650 --> 02:15:59,850
What?

1962
02:15:59,885 --> 02:16:02,185
The level of fighting
has decreased.

1963
02:16:02,222 --> 02:16:03,992
They only attack us
at night.

1964
02:16:04,023 --> 02:16:06,263
They're
playing possum.

1965
02:16:06,292 --> 02:16:08,162
The gestapo's informer
has told us

1966
02:16:08,194 --> 02:16:09,604
where their
command bunker is,

1967
02:16:09,629 --> 02:16:12,059
and this time, they
think it's accurate.

1968
02:16:12,097 --> 02:16:15,697
Well, that is good news,
isn't it?

1969
02:16:15,735 --> 02:16:17,765
Too good.

1970
02:16:19,104 --> 02:16:20,774
Too easy.

1971
02:16:20,806 --> 02:16:22,576
Is your ankle better?

1972
02:16:22,608 --> 02:16:23,478
Yes.

1973
02:16:23,509 --> 02:16:26,549
If you want to go, you can.
It's up to you.

1974
02:16:26,579 --> 02:16:28,179
I'd rather stay here
and fight

1975
02:16:28,214 --> 02:16:31,184
with you and arie,
if that's all right.

1976
02:16:31,217 --> 02:16:33,417
It's all right.

1977
02:16:39,325 --> 02:16:41,485
Where are
the sewer workers?

1978
02:16:43,062 --> 02:16:44,902
I don't know
what happened.

1979
02:16:44,930 --> 02:16:47,030
They were paid
to guide us.

1980
02:16:47,066 --> 02:16:48,966
But they haven't
shown up.

1981
02:16:50,135 --> 02:16:51,335
We need to go now.

1982
02:16:51,371 --> 02:16:53,171
This is far
too dangerous for you.

1983
02:16:53,205 --> 02:16:55,205
No. We are going into
the ghetto tonight,

1984
02:16:55,241 --> 02:16:57,441
if not through the sewers,
over the wall.

1985
02:16:57,477 --> 02:16:59,407
Are you
out of your mind?

1986
02:16:59,445 --> 02:17:01,245
We have no chance
without a plan.

1987
02:17:01,281 --> 02:17:02,381
Nor do the fighters

1988
02:17:02,415 --> 02:17:04,015
if we don't
get them out.

1989
02:17:04,049 --> 02:17:06,249
How will we do that
if we are shot?

1990
02:17:06,286 --> 02:17:07,286
I am going.

1991
02:17:07,320 --> 02:17:09,320
How do you intend
to get them out?

1992
02:17:09,355 --> 02:17:11,085
Are you with me
or not?

1993
02:17:11,123 --> 02:17:12,763
We have no chance to succeed

1994
02:17:12,792 --> 02:17:13,632
without a Polish guide

1995
02:17:13,659 --> 02:17:16,059
to take us into the sewers
and out again.

1996
02:17:16,095 --> 02:17:18,525
Do you see a guide?!

1997
02:17:18,564 --> 02:17:20,034
Do you?

1998
02:17:20,065 --> 02:17:22,965
There is no sewer worker!

1999
02:17:25,805 --> 02:17:27,205
Are you with me on that?

2000
02:17:27,239 --> 02:17:29,839
I will go with you,
Yitzhak.

2001
02:17:29,875 --> 02:17:31,035
Well, you can make

2002
02:17:31,076 --> 02:17:32,906
your own funeral
arrangements.

2003
02:17:32,945 --> 02:17:34,945
I will not carry
your coffin!

2004
02:17:41,654 --> 02:17:45,494
I will accompany you.
But he makes sense.

2005
02:17:45,525 --> 02:17:49,655
Maybe we should try again
tomorrow with the poles.

2006
02:17:49,695 --> 02:17:51,725
We can't rely
on the poles, frania.

2007
02:17:51,764 --> 02:17:55,374
We can't rely on anyone else
to get us in!

2008
02:17:56,936 --> 02:18:00,366
Zivia, when you get
down to the sewer, go left.

2009
02:18:00,406 --> 02:18:02,476
And let's hope
for the best.

2010
02:18:04,844 --> 02:18:07,754
I will cover your escape.

2011
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:11,020
Go. Before you forget
why you're leaving.

2012
02:18:11,050 --> 02:18:12,720
We'll be back.

2013
02:18:15,154 --> 02:18:16,894
Goodbye, Zachariah.

2014
02:18:20,826 --> 02:18:22,286
Be good, Zach.

2015
02:18:27,232 --> 02:18:30,202
Oh, come on.
You're already a day late!

2016
02:18:30,235 --> 02:18:31,565
Let's go!

2017
02:18:31,604 --> 02:18:32,644
Follow me.

2018
02:18:39,211 --> 02:18:41,951
Tell our friends to keep
their spirits up.

2019
02:18:49,922 --> 02:18:50,922
Ugh.

2020
02:18:53,926 --> 02:18:55,456
Oh!

2021
02:18:58,097 --> 02:18:59,567
Show me.

2022
02:18:59,599 --> 02:19:00,969
This way.

2023
02:19:05,371 --> 02:19:08,911
I just wish we had
more weapons and ammunition.

2024
02:19:11,276 --> 02:19:13,576
That would be really
something, huh?

2025
02:19:29,194 --> 02:19:30,734
What is it?

2026
02:19:33,466 --> 02:19:35,766
I just had
the most, uh...

2027
02:19:35,801 --> 02:19:37,971
Ridiculous dream.

2028
02:19:39,405 --> 02:19:42,435
It was so...Vivid.

2029
02:19:42,475 --> 02:19:44,435
I was sleeping,

2030
02:19:44,477 --> 02:19:47,107
and your sister
Gina came

2031
02:19:47,146 --> 02:19:48,776
and woke me up,

2032
02:19:48,814 --> 02:19:52,154
and she took me
outside to this...

2033
02:19:52,184 --> 02:19:54,454
Beautiful garden.

2034
02:19:54,487 --> 02:19:59,257
And there were grapes
and nuts and figs.

2035
02:20:00,460 --> 02:20:02,430
That's very biblical,
huh?

2036
02:20:02,462 --> 02:20:06,872
And then
she took me to a...

2037
02:20:06,899 --> 02:20:09,129
Basket.

2038
02:20:09,168 --> 02:20:13,308
And there was a...
A baby inside it.

2039
02:20:13,338 --> 02:20:15,808
And...

2040
02:20:15,841 --> 02:20:18,681
She said that he was

2041
02:20:18,711 --> 02:20:20,711
my...

2042
02:20:20,746 --> 02:20:22,716
My child.

2043
02:20:23,883 --> 02:20:26,193
And I took him,

2044
02:20:26,218 --> 02:20:29,148
and I held him
in my arms.

2045
02:20:35,360 --> 02:20:37,730
Tell me the history
of the eternal Jew.

2046
02:20:37,763 --> 02:20:41,333
How did this film of yours
come to be?

2047
02:20:41,366 --> 02:20:43,336
Goebbels
commissioned it.

2048
02:20:43,368 --> 02:20:46,208
It was, uh...His idea.

2049
02:20:46,238 --> 02:20:47,908
His pet project.

2050
02:20:47,940 --> 02:20:51,410
He felt that Germans
were not antisemitic enough.

2051
02:20:51,443 --> 02:20:53,983
It didn't come as easy
to them as, say,

2052
02:20:54,013 --> 02:20:56,883
the poles or the French
or even the English.

2053
02:20:56,916 --> 02:20:58,076
The film was the...

2054
02:20:58,117 --> 02:21:00,547
Psychological underpinning
of the fuhrer's plan

2055
02:21:00,586 --> 02:21:02,586
for racial purity.

2056
02:21:06,759 --> 02:21:08,689
Why do you think
these Jewish women

2057
02:21:08,728 --> 02:21:11,498
are such ferocious
fighters?

2058
02:21:11,531 --> 02:21:12,731
Desperation?

2059
02:21:12,765 --> 02:21:16,835
I've never witnessed this
before.

2060
02:21:16,869 --> 02:21:18,939
I saw one woman...

2061
02:21:18,971 --> 02:21:20,311
Shot several times.

2062
02:21:20,339 --> 02:21:22,369
As she was dying,
she cursed me

2063
02:21:22,407 --> 02:21:26,247
in a language
that was beyond vile.

2064
02:21:26,278 --> 02:21:29,078
I can't get the image
out of my mind.

2065
02:21:29,114 --> 02:21:31,154
Maybe you're
bewitched.

2066
02:21:33,586 --> 02:21:36,256
Here's to good bewitching.

2067
02:21:45,798 --> 02:21:46,868
Out!

2068
02:21:54,373 --> 02:21:55,713
Shh!

2069
02:22:10,455 --> 02:22:11,715
Shh!

2070
02:22:13,826 --> 02:22:15,086
Quiet!

2071
02:22:15,127 --> 02:22:16,257
Shh!

2072
02:22:19,531 --> 02:22:20,831
Check that tunnel.

2073
02:22:20,866 --> 02:22:24,066
See if it's passable,
Mira.

2074
02:22:24,103 --> 02:22:26,313
Tosia, down there.

2075
02:22:28,073 --> 02:22:29,543
Deworah.

2076
02:22:35,014 --> 02:22:37,554
Down there, Julian.

2077
02:22:37,583 --> 02:22:39,953
They can't have found
all 5 exits.

2078
02:22:39,985 --> 02:22:41,045
Hurry!

2079
02:22:53,198 --> 02:22:55,568
Blocked.
Completely blocked.

2080
02:23:13,385 --> 02:23:14,645
Mira!

2081
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:17,120
No, it's not safe.

2082
02:23:17,156 --> 02:23:18,716
Julian!

2083
02:23:21,627 --> 02:23:22,827
It's clear.

2084
02:23:22,862 --> 02:23:23,702
Yes?

2085
02:23:23,729 --> 02:23:25,999
We can make it out
through the sewer.

2086
02:23:44,049 --> 02:23:47,719
Maybe there is
a way to the sewers

2087
02:23:47,753 --> 02:23:49,153
through the cellar wall.

2088
02:23:49,188 --> 02:23:50,188
That way?

2089
02:23:50,222 --> 02:23:51,022
Yeah.

2090
02:23:51,056 --> 02:23:52,856
All right. Tosia,
go with Byah.

2091
02:23:52,892 --> 02:23:55,232
See if it's possible,
all right?

2092
02:24:13,612 --> 02:24:16,182
Mira! Mira! Hurry!
Go! Hurry!

2093
02:24:16,215 --> 02:24:18,045
We need reinforcements.

2094
02:24:23,555 --> 02:24:25,785
Spread out and try
to outflank them.

2095
02:24:34,700 --> 02:24:35,700
Find Zachariah.

2096
02:24:35,735 --> 02:24:37,795
Spread out
and create a diversion.

2097
02:24:42,041 --> 02:24:43,341
Hurry up, Gina.

2098
02:24:51,150 --> 02:24:52,220
Die!

2099
02:25:04,897 --> 02:25:07,367
The ghetto's
through this.

2100
02:25:07,399 --> 02:25:09,229
Good. Lead me.

2101
02:25:09,268 --> 02:25:11,798
No. I go no further.

2102
02:25:11,837 --> 02:25:14,507
You have been paid
to lead me.

2103
02:25:14,539 --> 02:25:16,839
I show you.
That's all.

2104
02:25:16,876 --> 02:25:19,236
As a member
of the home army,

2105
02:25:19,278 --> 02:25:20,548
it is
my assigned mission

2106
02:25:20,579 --> 02:25:21,849
to rescue
Christian poles

2107
02:25:21,881 --> 02:25:24,121
trapped in the ghetto.

2108
02:25:24,149 --> 02:25:26,449
If you do not wish
to cooperate,

2109
02:25:26,485 --> 02:25:28,915
then I will give you
a simple choice.

2110
02:25:33,725 --> 02:25:35,995
Lead me or die.

2111
02:25:39,498 --> 02:25:41,498
That is your choice.

2112
02:25:44,603 --> 02:25:46,413
Follow me.

2113
02:25:46,438 --> 02:25:48,408
Good decision.

2114
02:26:15,534 --> 02:26:17,074
The exits are sealed.

2115
02:26:17,102 --> 02:26:19,772
The fighters are all dead.

2116
02:26:19,805 --> 02:26:21,935
Ok, we stay.
We fight here.

2117
02:26:21,974 --> 02:26:24,214
Yeah. Let's go.
Let's go.

2118
02:26:24,243 --> 02:26:25,413
This way.

2119
02:26:25,444 --> 02:26:27,454
Quickly. Come on.

2120
02:26:31,917 --> 02:26:34,947
How much further
till we get to the ghetto?

2121
02:26:34,987 --> 02:26:37,417
Everything is sealed.
Is everybody in position?

2122
02:26:37,456 --> 02:26:38,856
If you don't
have a gun...

2123
02:26:38,891 --> 02:26:40,861
One person,
right through here.

2124
02:26:41,626 --> 02:26:43,096
Come on, move!

2125
02:26:43,128 --> 02:26:44,198
Every exit.

2126
02:26:44,229 --> 02:26:47,799
Julian, go see if tosia
has made any progress.

2127
02:26:47,833 --> 02:26:49,303
Right.
Move it! Move!

2128
02:26:57,609 --> 02:26:59,209
There's another wall.

2129
02:27:03,815 --> 02:27:05,945
Tosia. Tosia.

2130
02:27:05,985 --> 02:27:08,385
Have you found an entrance
to the sewer canals?

2131
02:27:08,420 --> 02:27:09,590
Not yet.

2132
02:27:09,621 --> 02:27:11,021
Hurry.

2133
02:27:11,056 --> 02:27:12,456
We are.

2134
02:27:32,844 --> 02:27:34,854
Mordechai,
I don't think

2135
02:27:34,880 --> 02:27:36,480
they'll make it
through soon enough.

2136
02:27:36,515 --> 02:27:37,415
I'm sorry.

2137
02:27:37,449 --> 02:27:39,619
All right, Julian.
Take your position.

2138
02:27:39,651 --> 02:27:41,251
You've done well.

2139
02:27:48,193 --> 02:27:50,233
I wonder if zivia
and the group

2140
02:27:50,262 --> 02:27:51,832
made it through.

2141
02:27:51,863 --> 02:27:53,473
Zivia will find
a way out.

2142
02:27:53,498 --> 02:27:56,438
I would have bet that
kazik found a way back.

2143
02:27:56,468 --> 02:27:57,868
I would have bet
on him.

2144
02:27:57,903 --> 02:28:01,143
He won't
disappoint you.

2145
02:28:01,173 --> 02:28:03,643
Mira, let me
ask you a question.

2146
02:28:03,675 --> 02:28:05,075
How is it you
always be

2147
02:28:05,110 --> 02:28:06,910
so positive,
so optimistic,

2148
02:28:06,946 --> 02:28:09,646
so, uh...
So supportive?

2149
02:28:11,250 --> 02:28:13,050
I'm lucky.

2150
02:28:16,721 --> 02:28:18,391
To luck, huh?

2151
02:28:20,392 --> 02:28:21,892
To luck.

2152
02:28:48,053 --> 02:28:50,863
Isaac, Sarah,
go through right now.

2153
02:28:50,889 --> 02:28:52,359
I'll go get Mordechai.

2154
02:28:56,962 --> 02:28:59,302
This way.

2155
02:29:05,070 --> 02:29:07,270
If you sense gas,

2156
02:29:07,306 --> 02:29:09,406
cover your faces
with a wet cloth

2157
02:29:09,441 --> 02:29:10,441
and stay low.

2158
02:29:10,475 --> 02:29:13,175
Cover your face and stay
low to the ground.

2159
02:29:19,351 --> 02:29:21,891
I found a way out!

2160
02:29:21,920 --> 02:29:23,890
Mordechai!

2161
02:29:23,922 --> 02:29:26,962
I found a way out
through the sewer!

2162
02:29:26,992 --> 02:29:28,962
Stay low!
Low to the ground!

2163
02:29:28,994 --> 02:29:30,364
Keep low.

2164
02:29:30,395 --> 02:29:31,655
Mordechai!

2165
02:29:33,732 --> 02:29:36,772
Save the last bullet
for yourself.

2166
02:29:36,801 --> 02:29:38,801
Help me, Mordechai!

2167
02:29:41,973 --> 02:29:44,043
Everyone follow me this way!

2168
02:29:44,076 --> 02:29:47,346
Now! I found the way out!

2169
02:29:47,379 --> 02:29:50,679
Let's give them a greeting
they'll remember.

2170
02:32:04,749 --> 02:32:06,419
Mordechai!

2171
02:32:07,952 --> 02:32:09,892
Zivia!

2172
02:32:09,921 --> 02:32:11,761
Deworah!

2173
02:32:11,790 --> 02:32:13,230
Tosia!

2174
02:33:18,790 --> 02:33:20,430
Kazik?

2175
02:33:21,726 --> 02:33:23,126
Kazik?!

2176
02:33:23,161 --> 02:33:25,801
Tosia.

2177
02:33:25,830 --> 02:33:27,770
Kazik.

2178
02:33:27,799 --> 02:33:29,899
Tosia?

2179
02:33:29,934 --> 02:33:32,644
Where are the others?

2180
02:33:36,275 --> 02:33:39,135
A few of us made it out
to the sewers, but...

2181
02:33:39,177 --> 02:33:41,347
Mordechai and Mira...

2182
02:33:41,380 --> 02:33:43,980
And almost all the rest
died here in the bunker.

2183
02:33:46,385 --> 02:33:48,585
How did you get in?

2184
02:33:50,188 --> 02:33:53,058
I thought...

2185
02:33:53,091 --> 02:33:55,161
I was the last Jew

2186
02:33:55,193 --> 02:33:57,003
in the ghetto.

2187
02:34:01,065 --> 02:34:02,825
The last one.

2188
02:34:04,503 --> 02:34:05,873
Kazik.

2189
02:34:05,904 --> 02:34:07,144
Kazik!

2190
02:34:07,171 --> 02:34:11,111
How did you get in?

2191
02:34:11,142 --> 02:34:14,112
Through the sewer canals.

2192
02:34:14,145 --> 02:34:16,105
Then you will take us out.

2193
02:34:16,147 --> 02:34:17,147
No...

2194
02:34:17,181 --> 02:34:18,851
Yes.

2195
02:34:18,883 --> 02:34:20,293
Come.
No.

2196
02:34:20,319 --> 02:34:21,889
Kazik, come!

2197
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:23,250
I want to stay here.

2198
02:34:23,288 --> 02:34:25,088
There are others
who need our help.

2199
02:34:25,123 --> 02:34:26,393
No...

2200
02:34:51,249 --> 02:34:53,519
Paradise.

2201
02:35:27,285 --> 02:35:29,385
This way.

2202
02:35:44,135 --> 02:35:46,335
In the tunnel.

2203
02:36:10,194 --> 02:36:11,864
All right.

2204
02:36:17,736 --> 02:36:19,036
Wait.

2205
02:36:49,133 --> 02:36:50,903
Shh. Shh.

2206
02:36:53,438 --> 02:36:55,038
Get back.

2207
02:37:21,232 --> 02:37:23,102
Paradise.

2208
02:37:29,173 --> 02:37:31,213
Paradise?

2209
02:37:31,242 --> 02:37:32,782
Yes.

2210
02:37:36,347 --> 02:37:38,217
Kazik?!

2211
02:37:38,249 --> 02:37:39,649
Tosia!

2212
02:37:46,024 --> 02:37:47,894
It's a miracle!

2213
02:37:47,926 --> 02:37:48,826
We were lost.

2214
02:37:48,860 --> 02:37:50,460
We've been walking
in circles.

2215
02:37:50,495 --> 02:37:51,955
It's like a miracle!

2216
02:37:51,996 --> 02:37:52,826
Kazik, tell me,

2217
02:37:52,864 --> 02:37:54,874
have you been
to the other side?

2218
02:37:54,899 --> 02:37:56,099
Yes, he has.

2219
02:37:56,134 --> 02:37:58,604
Then he is
our leader.

2220
02:38:00,371 --> 02:38:01,811
All right.

2221
02:38:01,840 --> 02:38:02,840
All right.
Ok.

2222
02:38:04,042 --> 02:38:05,212
Good luck, everyone.

2223
02:38:05,243 --> 02:38:08,313
Quickly and quietly.

2224
02:38:08,346 --> 02:38:10,476
Follow me.

2225
02:38:10,515 --> 02:38:12,575
Come on. Come, Sarah.

2226
02:38:28,466 --> 02:38:30,596
Heil Hitler.

2227
02:38:30,635 --> 02:38:32,265
One of major Hoffer's
SS informants

2228
02:38:32,303 --> 02:38:34,513
says some of the leaders
are still alive.

2229
02:38:34,539 --> 02:38:36,509
He's heard that
they've taken the sewers

2230
02:38:36,541 --> 02:38:39,341
to the Aryan side to join up
with the partisans

2231
02:38:39,377 --> 02:38:40,847
and continue to fight.

2232
02:38:40,879 --> 02:38:43,479
The major wanted me
to inform you of this

2233
02:38:43,514 --> 02:38:45,524
as soon as possible.

2234
02:39:05,269 --> 02:39:07,469
Yitzhak,

2235
02:39:07,505 --> 02:39:09,235
we need a truck.

2236
02:39:09,273 --> 02:39:11,043
We need it
for 2 nights.

2237
02:39:13,578 --> 02:39:17,018
Trucks are expensive.

2238
02:39:17,048 --> 02:39:18,748
I wish I could.

2239
02:39:18,783 --> 02:39:21,253
I thought you might
say this.

2240
02:39:30,161 --> 02:39:31,161
Turn back.

2241
02:39:31,195 --> 02:39:32,195
No.

2242
02:39:32,230 --> 02:39:34,430
Wait. Wait.

2243
02:39:34,465 --> 02:39:36,865
All right.
Under here.

2244
02:39:39,070 --> 02:39:40,070
It's all right.

2245
02:39:40,104 --> 02:39:41,114
Watch your head.

2246
02:39:41,139 --> 02:39:42,569
Come under here.

2247
02:39:42,607 --> 02:39:44,107
Under here.

2248
02:39:46,344 --> 02:39:47,514
All right. Zivia.

2249
02:39:47,545 --> 02:39:48,545
Ok.

2250
02:39:48,579 --> 02:39:49,779
Come through.

2251
02:39:49,814 --> 02:39:51,484
Ah!

2252
02:39:51,515 --> 02:39:52,945
Now...tosia.

2253
02:39:52,984 --> 02:39:54,294
She must be quick.

2254
02:39:54,318 --> 02:39:56,148
The water's rising.

2255
02:39:56,187 --> 02:39:57,217
Come through.

2256
02:39:57,255 --> 02:39:58,655
Where's the boy
and the girl?

2257
02:39:58,690 --> 02:40:01,530
Sarah.
He's coming through.

2258
02:40:01,559 --> 02:40:02,689
Sarah.

2259
02:40:02,727 --> 02:40:04,297
Isaac, come here.

2260
02:40:04,328 --> 02:40:06,058
I'll go up here.

2261
02:40:06,097 --> 02:40:08,127
Right here, Isaac.

2262
02:40:08,166 --> 02:40:09,766
Go slowly ahead!

2263
02:40:09,801 --> 02:40:11,341
All right,
is everybody through?

2264
02:40:11,369 --> 02:40:12,969
We've got to get
through quickly.

2265
02:40:13,004 --> 02:40:14,044
Coming through!

2266
02:40:47,672 --> 02:40:49,112
The baby's gone!

2267
02:40:53,611 --> 02:40:55,051
My baby!

2268
02:41:26,544 --> 02:41:28,084
Come on.

2269
02:41:35,854 --> 02:41:37,424
It's shut.
It's welded shut.

2270
02:41:37,455 --> 02:41:39,285
It's welded shut!

2271
02:41:39,323 --> 02:41:40,663
Please don't panic.

2272
02:41:47,398 --> 02:41:48,498
Don't push. Be calm.

2273
02:42:05,784 --> 02:42:07,824
A little bit further on,

2274
02:42:07,852 --> 02:42:09,822
it opens out
to a canal.

2275
02:42:09,854 --> 02:42:12,364
That's the beginning
of the Aryan side.

2276
02:42:36,915 --> 02:42:39,275
Well, we are
across the street

2277
02:42:39,317 --> 02:42:41,047
from the Aryan side,

2278
02:42:41,085 --> 02:42:43,785
but there is no one
waiting for us up above.

2279
02:42:43,822 --> 02:42:45,522
We cannot hold on
any longer.

2280
02:42:45,556 --> 02:42:47,556
There is nowhere to take
all these people

2281
02:42:47,591 --> 02:42:48,631
out on the street

2282
02:42:48,659 --> 02:42:51,299
without a truck
to get us out of the city.

2283
02:42:51,329 --> 02:42:52,329
Kazik...

2284
02:42:52,363 --> 02:42:53,703
You go by yourself.

2285
02:42:53,731 --> 02:42:55,471
We'll go back,
find an exit.

2286
02:42:55,499 --> 02:42:57,399
Yes, tonight.

2287
02:43:24,028 --> 02:43:26,398
Jan.

2288
02:43:52,390 --> 02:43:53,690
Where is it?

2289
02:43:53,724 --> 02:43:56,534
I don't know.
They're late.

2290
02:43:56,560 --> 02:43:58,600
We can't afford late.

2291
02:44:23,054 --> 02:44:25,094
There's been a delay.

2292
02:44:25,123 --> 02:44:27,993
They will try again later.

2293
02:44:28,026 --> 02:44:32,026
We must keep everyone calm.

2294
02:44:34,465 --> 02:44:36,495
I'll let them know.

2295
02:44:42,440 --> 02:44:43,980
Yes. An office.

2296
02:44:44,008 --> 02:44:46,478
54 Proster street.

2297
02:44:48,046 --> 02:44:50,076
Office furniture.

2298
02:44:50,614 --> 02:44:52,584
Cabinets.

2299
02:44:52,616 --> 02:44:53,916
No, just the driver.

2300
02:44:53,952 --> 02:44:56,722
We have our own laborers.

2301
02:44:56,754 --> 02:44:57,794
You can?

2302
02:44:57,821 --> 02:45:00,021
We must have water.
We must have food.

2303
02:45:00,058 --> 02:45:01,988
Please, stay calm.

2304
02:45:02,026 --> 02:45:03,426
We're doing all we can.

2305
02:45:03,461 --> 02:45:04,261
It's not enough.

2306
02:45:04,295 --> 02:45:06,095
I would rather
die on the street

2307
02:45:06,130 --> 02:45:07,170
with a German bullet.

2308
02:45:07,198 --> 02:45:09,398
You will do exactly
as you are instructed.

2309
02:45:09,433 --> 02:45:10,373
Now be quiet.

2310
02:45:10,401 --> 02:45:12,001
There is another
landing down there.

2311
02:45:12,036 --> 02:45:13,636
Go! Get out
of the water.

2312
02:45:13,671 --> 02:45:15,271
The people
cannot take any more!

2313
02:45:15,306 --> 02:45:16,136
Silence yourself.

2314
02:45:16,174 --> 02:45:18,184
Do you think I will
let your weakness

2315
02:45:18,209 --> 02:45:19,979
jeopardize the lives
of these people?

2316
02:45:20,011 --> 02:45:21,411
Have any notion

2317
02:45:21,445 --> 02:45:23,205
the sacrifices
these fighters have made

2318
02:45:23,247 --> 02:45:25,247
so that you can be
here alive?

2319
02:45:25,283 --> 02:45:26,083
I know--

2320
02:45:26,117 --> 02:45:27,717
alive on the verge
of freedom!

2321
02:45:27,751 --> 02:45:28,951
I want to get out!

2322
02:45:28,987 --> 02:45:31,187
Don't think for a moment
that I will hesitate

2323
02:45:31,222 --> 02:45:33,022
to put a bullet
through your skull,

2324
02:45:33,057 --> 02:45:34,057
fulfill your wish,

2325
02:45:34,092 --> 02:45:35,732
if you keep
this foolishness up.

2326
02:45:35,759 --> 02:45:36,999
Shut up!

2327
02:45:56,780 --> 02:45:58,780
Where is your office?
I don't see it.

2328
02:45:58,816 --> 02:46:00,916
In the basement.

2329
02:46:00,951 --> 02:46:02,151
Oh! What is this?

2330
02:46:02,186 --> 02:46:04,786
This is your chance
to be a hero before god.

2331
02:46:04,822 --> 02:46:06,222
Drive.

2332
02:46:10,728 --> 02:46:12,298
Pull over there.

2333
02:46:32,016 --> 02:46:34,416
Please,
quickly and quietly,

2334
02:46:34,452 --> 02:46:36,352
and do exactly
as kazik instructs.

2335
02:46:45,396 --> 02:46:48,896
Marek, why are we doing
this in broad daylight?

2336
02:46:48,932 --> 02:46:51,642
Because we are.

2337
02:46:51,669 --> 02:46:54,109
You're mad.

2338
02:46:54,772 --> 02:46:56,712
You were right.

2339
02:47:00,978 --> 02:47:02,678
Are there many more?

2340
02:47:02,713 --> 02:47:03,753
Yes, there are more.

2341
02:47:03,781 --> 02:47:04,851
How many?

2342
02:47:04,882 --> 02:47:05,882
40 on this landing

2343
02:47:05,916 --> 02:47:07,516
and a dozen
on another landing.

2344
02:47:07,551 --> 02:47:08,551
We can't wait.

2345
02:47:08,586 --> 02:47:09,586
They will come.

2346
02:47:21,832 --> 02:47:23,832
We can't wait.

2347
02:47:23,867 --> 02:47:26,267
I promised them.

2348
02:47:30,774 --> 02:47:32,214
One more minute.

2349
02:47:32,243 --> 02:47:34,513
One minute,
and then we leave.

2350
02:47:34,545 --> 02:47:35,345
I'll get them.

2351
02:47:35,379 --> 02:47:36,809
We don't have
enough time.

2352
02:47:36,847 --> 02:47:38,747
I'll get them.

2353
02:47:38,782 --> 02:47:40,382
Quickly, quickly.

2354
02:47:40,418 --> 02:47:41,448
20 more.

2355
02:47:52,263 --> 02:47:55,373
Come, come, come,
come, come, come.

2356
02:48:00,571 --> 02:48:03,941
This is an operation
of the Polish underground.

2357
02:48:03,974 --> 02:48:06,444
And I believe in
Santa Claus.

2358
02:48:07,445 --> 02:48:09,245
Well, Santa...

2359
02:48:09,280 --> 02:48:11,680
This is a pistol
I'm pointing in your ribs.

2360
02:48:11,715 --> 02:48:12,945
Do you believe that?

2361
02:48:12,983 --> 02:48:14,123
Yes.

2362
02:48:14,152 --> 02:48:16,352
Then you will also believe
that I won't hesitate

2363
02:48:16,387 --> 02:48:18,387
to splatter your guts
all over the cobblestones

2364
02:48:18,422 --> 02:48:20,922
unless you do
exactly as I say.

2365
02:48:20,958 --> 02:48:23,258
You stay there.

2366
02:48:24,995 --> 02:48:27,465
Into the truck.

2367
02:48:27,498 --> 02:48:29,798
10 more.

2368
02:48:29,833 --> 02:48:32,473
Hurry up! Hurry! Now!

2369
02:48:40,311 --> 02:48:42,851
They're Jews.

2370
02:48:49,287 --> 02:48:50,817
That's everyone
on this landing.

2371
02:48:50,854 --> 02:48:52,664
14 total. Come, kazik.

2372
02:48:53,557 --> 02:48:54,827
That's it.

2373
02:48:54,858 --> 02:48:56,828
I am not leaving
without them.

2374
02:48:56,860 --> 02:48:58,760
You are putting us all
at risk.

2375
02:49:00,364 --> 02:49:02,804
I am not asking you,
I am telling you.

2376
02:49:02,833 --> 02:49:03,873
Zivia.

2377
02:49:03,901 --> 02:49:05,701
Get on the truck.

2378
02:49:05,736 --> 02:49:07,266
Zivia...

2379
02:49:07,305 --> 02:49:09,165
Get on the truck.

2380
02:49:09,207 --> 02:49:10,937
We will come back
for them.

2381
02:49:10,974 --> 02:49:12,844
Go.

2382
02:49:16,680 --> 02:49:19,480
Go! Go! Go!

2383
02:49:21,252 --> 02:49:22,852
Go, go, go, go!

2384
02:49:22,886 --> 02:49:24,316
Go! Go!

2385
02:50:15,172 --> 02:50:17,712
They've escaped.

2386
02:50:17,741 --> 02:50:20,341
It seems to be so.

2387
02:50:22,045 --> 02:50:23,575
I'm going to have you
communicate

2388
02:50:23,614 --> 02:50:25,384
to reichsfuhrer Himmler
that Warsaw

2389
02:50:25,416 --> 02:50:28,886
will be free of Jews
tomorrow.

2390
02:50:28,919 --> 02:50:30,719
My engineers
have prepared dynamite

2391
02:50:30,754 --> 02:50:33,364
in the Jews' synagogue.

2392
02:50:33,391 --> 02:50:36,191
Further,
I've informed Himmler

2393
02:50:36,226 --> 02:50:38,526
that the remainder
of our work here

2394
02:50:38,562 --> 02:50:40,762
will be carried out
by the local police

2395
02:50:40,798 --> 02:50:42,568
under my control.

2396
02:50:44,034 --> 02:50:45,904
Now, you may
even receive

2397
02:50:45,936 --> 02:50:47,366
a commendation

2398
02:50:47,405 --> 02:50:49,405
for your efforts.

2399
02:50:49,440 --> 02:50:51,580
But between you and me,

2400
02:50:51,609 --> 02:50:54,649
you let the bandits
get away.

2401
02:51:11,194 --> 02:51:13,164
I want everything
brought up!

2402
02:51:13,196 --> 02:51:15,296
Every body, every corpse,

2403
02:51:15,333 --> 02:51:16,803
every piece of evidence!

2404
02:51:16,834 --> 02:51:18,174
And then seal it shut.

2405
02:51:18,201 --> 02:51:20,141
Tighter than
the pharaoh's tomb,

2406
02:51:20,170 --> 02:51:22,210
and every manhole cover
in Warsaw

2407
02:51:22,239 --> 02:51:24,109
I want welded shut!

2408
02:51:24,141 --> 02:51:26,581
Every single one!

2409
02:51:33,183 --> 02:51:34,753
Enough!

2410
02:51:39,156 --> 02:51:41,116
Mordechai Anielewicz
sent me this letter

2411
02:51:41,158 --> 02:51:43,388
shortly before
his last battle.

2412
02:51:43,427 --> 02:51:46,597
I want to read
a part of it to you.

2413
02:51:48,165 --> 02:51:50,165
"Our fighters
have endured conditions

2414
02:51:50,200 --> 02:51:52,870
"beyond description.

2415
02:51:52,903 --> 02:51:54,373
"Yet they have persevered--

2416
02:51:54,405 --> 02:51:57,265
"no, more than persevered.

2417
02:51:57,307 --> 02:52:00,207
"They have conquered
these conditions

2418
02:52:00,243 --> 02:52:01,683
"and fought on bravely

2419
02:52:01,712 --> 02:52:04,352
"over and over

2420
02:52:04,382 --> 02:52:06,652
"and over again.

2421
02:52:06,684 --> 02:52:10,324
"Perhaps we shall
meet again.

2422
02:52:10,354 --> 02:52:11,924
Perhaps."

2423
02:52:13,023 --> 02:52:14,393
"But the main thing is,

2424
02:52:14,425 --> 02:52:18,255
"the dream of my life
has come true.

2425
02:52:18,295 --> 02:52:21,125
"I have lived to see
a Jewish defense

2426
02:52:21,164 --> 02:52:22,334
"in the ghetto

2427
02:52:22,366 --> 02:52:24,896
"in all its greatness

2428
02:52:24,935 --> 02:52:26,565
and glory."

2429
02:52:28,406 --> 02:52:30,936
Let us remember Mordechai

2430
02:52:30,974 --> 02:52:33,044
and all the others,

2431
02:52:33,076 --> 02:52:35,576
and let us continue.

2432
02:52:35,613 --> 02:52:38,583
Let us continue to fight on.

2433
02:53:52,823 --> 02:53:54,763
Look, kazik.

2434
02:53:54,792 --> 02:53:57,062
Look how deeply
they breathe.

2435
02:53:59,162 --> 02:54:01,572
Each breath...

2436
02:54:01,599 --> 02:54:05,799
So peaceful, so rhythmic.

2437
02:54:05,836 --> 02:54:07,566
Yes.

2438
02:54:09,773 --> 02:54:13,913
One after another
after another...

2439
02:54:13,944 --> 02:54:15,954
After another.
