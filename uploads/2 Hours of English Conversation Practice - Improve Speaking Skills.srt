question so think about

1047
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,240
question so think about
the default response that you can spit

1048
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,250
the default response that you can spit

1049
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,520
the default response that you can spit
out that you can quickly say if it's how

1050

tonight think about like just a handful

1056
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:38,670
tonight think about like just a handful

1057
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,420
tonight think about like just a handful
meaning just a few responses to those

1058
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:41,430
meaning just a few responses to those

1059
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,850
meaning just a few responses to those
questions and train them quickly just

1060
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:43,860
questions and train them quickly just

1061
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,130
questions and train them quickly just
how are you I'm good how are you I'm

1062
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:46,140
how are you I'm good how are you I'm

1065
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,850
okay how are you not bad there's three
so it's just training responses to those

1066
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:52,860
so it's just training responses to those

1067
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,070
so it's just training responses to those
questions there's no reason to be

like that's a very common question so

1072
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:00,150
like that's a very common question so

1073
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,450
like that's a very common question so
for those common questions trained

1074
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:02,460
for those common questions trained

1075
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,550
for those common questions trained
responses to that we've got a bunch of

00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:04,560
responses to that we've got a bunch of

1077
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,040
responses to that we've got a bunch of
videos especially beginner level videos

1078
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,050

the system of planets and objects which

3933
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:11,490
the system of planets and objects which
are near our star so our solar system

3934
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:11,500
are near our star so our solar system

3935
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,350

again in Pluto eight planets in our

3940
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:17,680
again in Pluto eight planets in our

3941
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:20,400
again in Pluto eight planets in our
solar system and then we can talk about

3942
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:20,410
solar system and then we can talk about

3943
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:22,920

might happen in space within our solar

3951
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,660
might happen in space within our solar
system so our solar system is the area

3952
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:35,670
system so our solar system is the area

3953
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:38,280
system so our solar system is the area
surrounding our Sun and our planets that

3954

3955
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:40,080
surrounding our Sun and our planets that
we know of in a sentence

3956
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:40,090
we know of in a sentence

3957
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:42,650

slightly melting and then releasing

3965
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,420
slightly melting and then releasing
gases so that's what produces that look

3966
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:54,430
gases so that's what produces that look

3967
01:22:54,430 --> 01:22:57,060

a comet okay in a sentence comets are

3968
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:57,070
a comet okay in a sentence comets are

3969
01:22:57,070 --> 01:23:01,380
a comet okay in a sentence comets are
really cool meteor alright so yes the

3970
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:01,390
really cool meteor alright so yes the

3971
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:03,750
really cool meteor alright so yes the
next word is meteor or meteor or just

meteor

3975
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:06,510
meteor
so essentially meteors are different

3976
01:23:06,510 --> 01:23:06,520
so essentially meteors are different

3977
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,490
so essentially meteors are different
from comets because comets are made of

3978
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:08,500
from comets because comets are made of

3979
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,580
from comets because comets are made of
ice meteors however are made of rock so

3980
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:11,590
ice meteors however are made of rock so

3981
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:13,500
ice meteors however are made of rock so
these are two different kinds of objects

3982
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:13,510
these are two different kinds of objects

3983
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:16,500
these are two different kinds of objects

01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:19,440
that can that move around in space in a
sentence lots of meteors burn up before

3986
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:19,450

they pass through the atmosphere

3988
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:21,450
they pass through the atmosphere

3989
01:23:21,450 --> 01:23:24,750
they pass through the atmosphere
meteorite the next word is meteor right

3990
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:24,760
meteorite the next word is meteor right

3991
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:26,790
meteorite the next word is meteor right
meteor right so this is an important

3992
01:23:26,790 --> 01:23:26,800
meteor right so this is an important

3993
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,830

01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,650
too so a meteor is the is the space
rockets in space or it's in the

4000
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:34,660
rockets in space or it's in the

4001
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:37,830
rockets in space or it's in the
atmosphere a meteor right however is the

4002
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:37,840
atmosphere a meteor right however is the

4003
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,920
atmosphere a meteor right however is the
rock if if the meteor makes it if the

4004
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:40,930
rock if if the meteor makes it if the

4005
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:42,750
rock if if the meteor makes it if the
meteor can pass through the Earth's

4006
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:42,760
meteor can pass through the Earth's

4007
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:46,080
meteor can pass through the Earth's
atmosphere and fall to the surface of

4008
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:46,090
atmosphere and fall to the surface of

4009
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:48,090
atmosphere and fall to the surface of
the earth that rock then is called a

4010
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:48,100
the earth that rock then is called a

4011
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:51,270
the earth that rock then is called a
meteor right so in space in the

4012
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:51,280
meteor right so in space in the

4013
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,430
meteor right so in space in the
atmosphere it's a meteor when it falls

4014
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:53,440
atmosphere it's a meteor when it falls

4015
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,590
atmosphere it's a meteor when it falls
to earth it is a meteorite that becomes

4016
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:55,600
to earth it is a meteorite that becomes

4017
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,600
to earth it is a meteorite that becomes
a meteorite when it hits the earth so

4018
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:57,610
a meteorite when it hits the earth so
